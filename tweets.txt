   @killallwalkers Hehe, that leg was delicious too. After a year with no human to gnaw on, I was ready to eat.
   @killallwalkers Haha, funny story. Before I bit Hershel, Daryl came and asked if I minded that he toss my body out of the way. ;-)
   @killallwalkers meh, you'd probably be stringy. I like my legs aged like a fine wine.
   @killallwalkers Careful, I'm a crafty zombie, Hershel is minus a leg cause of me. I just don't quit.

   @GregMercer1 @philo_quotes the only reason our allies didn't turn on us is because we have more nukes and a willingness to use them.
   @GregMercer1 @philo_quotes Plus how can you trust a religion who's \god\ holds knowledge as evil? Have family who needed vital medical help?
   @GregMercer1 @philo_quotes and the process is flawed. \Separation of church and state\ cannot exist with religion focused candidates.

   @RichardJNunn @twdgermany that was my last weekend :-P
   @RichardJNunn @twdgermany Shot on the fence, chasing Andrea, and Hershel off the farm. Basically this zombie did the Multiplicity thing :P
   @RichardJNunn @twdgermany I started for the season 2 finale. Inside the barn with my face on fire, breaking in to the barn (door and side)
   @whart31 Kids, do not follow that path, lol. I am beyond lucky, I just have a path less traveled to success. It's a process really.
   @RichardJNunn @twdgermany Yeah, I really tried to be a good student, but then I skipped lots of school to be a zombie. ;)
   @Dinelle_Fuller you'd the best
   @RichardJNunn @twdgermany Yeah, I'm a bad student, but a quick study. I think it's called autodidactic.
   @Dinelle_Fuller I haven't had a Friday off in ages
   @Dinelle_Fuller right, i don't know what to do with myself.Vampire Diaries moved the Friday shoot to Monday.

       terrible
   @ComcastMattV only by pretending to be a new customer. It's clear the company cares about new customers more than existing ones. #terrible
   @ComcastMattV 4 days without net this month, plus daily outages. My biggest issue is that as a paying customer, I can connect with a rep...
       TerribleBarPickupLines
   So in light of a conversation with @I_Am_Nathena @Horserider2012... Lets play with a hastag.... #TerribleBarPickupLines.
   @I_Am_Nathena @Horserider2012 You must have been to a bar at some point in your life. Hear some of the craziest things there.
   @Horserider2012 @I_Am_Nathena They reimbursed me instead. It was too much hassle ;-)
   @Horserider2012 @i_am_nathena huckleberry, tequila and chipotle de sol is my mix ;)
   @truthglow nah, that justunfollow thing has a pay to be able to unfollow more than 50 a day (without tweet it's 25).
   @HendleyX Haha, don't get work if we don't keep ourselves current. It's a necessary bit to keep working :p.
   @I_Am_Nathena @horserider2012 Hey if you don't fix my Internet I'm gonna bite your leg!\\n\n\Oh really?!? *sultry voice* is that a promise?\
   @truthglow ^^ hate that I have to do that spamming crap to avoid paying, haha.
   @HendleyX LOTS of updating over the next week.
   @spl132db Hell no, scares the shit out of them. I always come armed with a full arsenal of tricks, plus research on local laws, etc. ;-)
       followback
   @truthglow once you hit 2k following you have to go up proportionally. I have to drop non-followers to be able to #followback
   @Horserider2012 @I_Am_Nathena Haha, I wish that threats of biting worked out better in grownup Amerika.
   @spl132db Or use the words \I'm calling on behalf of my client....\ ;-)
   @spl132db that I get disconnected calling them, but new service customer, instant pickup. Usually changes their tune right away ;-)
   @spl132db I just call in as a new customer, when they pick up in 2 seconds I explain that I think it's odd that as a paying customer...
   @Dinelle_Fuller So much to take care of over the weekend. Agency is updating their site so I have to do a lot of updating to keep up.
   @comcast got disconnected calling as a current customer. Only reason I'm a customer is I haven't found an alternative company in my area.
   @comcast why are y'all STILL terrible customer service. I have to pretend to be a new customer to get ANY help. Plus net drops constantly.
   @CestMoiLizzy got a credit, not as much as I would like, but better than nothing.
   @Horserider2012 @I_Am_Nathena Yeah on hold to do just that

   @TerriKing1221 sadly right now it's have more and bigger bombs, but that'll just destroy us all, likely.

   @TerriKing1221 frankly, with our failing education system, it's no surprise.

       screwing
   @TerriKing1221 or get right into work and likely make $40k every year to start. #screwing today's youth so some asshole can be fat.
   @TerriKing1221 right? Can goto college, spend 20-30k a year on future debt, and then not find anything better than you could get prior.
   @TerriKing1221 read up on body language and NLP.

   @AgeJustNumbers @slaygoth and in both places after a divorce you still call your spouse brother or sister haha
   @Slaygoth well, being a scientist, buildings that fall at free fall speed have nothing below them... Aka pancake theory is impossible
   @AgeJustNumbers @slaygoth probably why he is no longer with us
   @Slaygoth after the 9\/11 story that is defies the laws of physics, I don't really believe what story we are fed.
   @Slaygoth Hindu people often are, seriously go to a Mandir with him. You will be amazed at the beauty.
   Here is the local Mandir website. Entirely hand carved, in India and shipped over. \n\n http:\/\/t.co\/iPXZIpL4nX
   @Slaygoth I have little doubt that it was, although this seems a bit more in line for people hiding in caves from our military.
   @Slaygoth sadly, it's that attitude that causes places in the world to want to bomb us, among other things.
   @Slaygoth not allowed to vote, 3 days prior to the election.
   @Slaygoth voted for had the rupiblican state not cut them off. I myself had that happen in Atl, registered liberal type, voter reg came back
   @Slaygoth  no surprise there. Proven that denials for voter registration went out to low income areas last election. Wonder who they woulda
   @Slaygoth I might not have been so calm. Go visit a Hindu Mandir, then tell me the cystine chapel is more than just paint on a wall.
   @Slaygoth that shit makes me sick to my stomach to be an American. Small wonder much of the world hates us.
   @Slaygoth did you knock and asshole out?
   @JailBaitBLUES @slaygoth lol nice.
   @JailBaitBLUES @slaygoth just like a woman, always shunting away compliments. Thanks dude :)

   @TWDsBiggestFan @hazex_69 if you ask nicely enough.

   @BonicaBijou remember, tv is based on the comic, @RobertKirkman has been good about keeping even his oldest fans guessing.
   @Cheri_TWD @horserider2012 plenty if time to sleep when I am dead.
   @BonicaBijou that's what I'm wondering, comic and tv gov look nothing alike, tv Gov acts similar, but way less dark.
   @Horserider2012 @cheri_twd lol, I don't blame you. I might do so myself.

   @jessicabaldemor I'm just disappointed Govey went wuss on her.
   @jessicabaldemor I kinda like him, especially since we haven't seen him get incredibly dark yet.
   @linewife1393 I hope so too.
   @jessicabaldemor yeah coffee at night means I stay up the rest of it.
       twd
   @jessicabaldemor aye no more tacos n #twd. Wonder if @TwistedTacoPer1 got some fun Sunday stuff to take our mind off it :p
   @linewife1393 I blame the group for having the medic on the front line.
       awesome
   @linewife1393 every day on set is #awesome, even if they aren't always comfortable. The end result is worth ever bruise, scrape and pain.
   @_hellokittay thanks for all the Rt's :)

   @linewife1393 I'm always excited to be on set, after spending 2 weeks in s2 finale I consider em all friends, I was sad he was going ;).
   @linewife1393 lol, I think they misunderstood. I was under the impression that my bite was killing him. 6 hours is a long time to be silent.
   @jessicabaldemor aye that would be me. Hello there :)

       twdfamily
   @lovesflanery @horserider2012 @phoboska I love that my twitter has become a #twdfamily meeting ground.
       amazing
   @spl132db keep reading Tyresse is an #amazing asset. @RobertKirkman made a totally badass character with him.
   @phoboska @lovesflanery @horserider2012 you too.
       glorious
       disgusting
       zombies
       amazing
   @TraceyMarie76 me too, days on set are #glorious. Watching Greg and the KNB team turn you into #disgusting #zombies is beyond #amazing.
       epic
       comics
   @spl132db he has an #epic scene in the #comics, we may yet see his breaking point.
       zombie
   @Annie__Hall @wwwbigbaldhead I think a lady #zombie will get to eat him haha.
       hershel
   @TraceyMarie76 on call sadly. I won't know if my #hershel chase continues for a bit.
   @spl132db I wanna see Tyresse break... He's kinda wimpy to replace T-dog right now.
   @lovesflanery @phoboska @horserider2012 I left 10 min ago
   @Annie__Hall he is, but his transformation into what the apocalypse makes out of people intrigues me.
   @phoboska @horserider2012 @lovesflanery @robertkirkman he deserves his eye removed in the comics... And MUCH worse. You see nice gov ;)
   @phoboska @horserider2012 @lovesflanery already registered :)
       madness
       gov
   @spl132db As demonstrated, the loss of everyone you love tends to drive people to #madness. #gov finally did some dirty work.
   @codynstac thanks for the Rt :)
   @TraceyMarie76 that first part made every guy's attention perk for a min ;)
       happy
       slaughter
   @Annie__Hall I am #happy the gov lives to fight again. He has only done one bit himself, #slaughter his people bailing on him.
   @lovesflanery @phoboska @horserider2012 perfect safe word for her then haha
   @phoboska @horserider2012 @lovesflanery June 10th classes start again :0
       glen

       twisted

   @phoboska @horserider2012 @lovesflanery @robertkirkman I hope Govey #returns closer to the #twisted #comic version.
       hippies
   @phoboska @horserider2012 @lovesflanery damn #hippies.
       love
       Hershel
       farm
       leg
       bride
       next
   I #love that my #Hershel chase may continue another season. First I took his #farm, then his #leg. Perhaps the #bride to be is #next?
   @Meljoehigg thanks my dear
       love
   @phoboska @horserider2012 @lovesflanery thanks my dear :-) and for spreading the #love
   @phoboska @horserider2012 @lovesflanery I did not know they had phones that old
   @phoboska @horserider2012 @lovesflanery @robertkirkman that is a LONG span considering prison arc starts Volume 2 ;)
       hershel
       Merle
   @phoboska @horserider2012 @lovesflanery probably why #hershel looked like a Turkey. Might also be why #Merle didn't find his meth.
       twitter
       crap
   @phoboska @horserider2012 @lovesflanery I do it all the time, iPhone app is WAY better than web. #twitter website is #crap.
       badass
       villains
       prison
   @phoboska @horserider2012 @lovesflanery comics span over 100 issues. I'm SURE @RobertKirkman has some #badass #villains past the #prison.
   @phoboska @horserider2012 @lovesflanery Thc, LSD, MDMA, pcp, etc makes alphabet soup. Who the hell knows what that damned hippie ate ;)

   @Horserider2012 @phoboska @lovesflanery lol, if that was the only biting rep I had haha
   @phoboska I love that feeling of smoking home rolled cigs... All the stuff to spit out, rawer that gets me going.
   @phoboska @horserider2012 @lovesflanery where you have to spend the day if there is an issue with your drivers license. And yes, it's a day

   @phoboska @lovesflanery @horserider2012 That's Gypsy too, she just had an old day. Was so sad to see my big puppy show signs of her age
   @Horserider2012 @lovesflanery @phoboska had a cat that would lie in wait for contractors as a kid. Milk or her bit h for the day. Lol
   @phoboska @lovesflanery @horserider2012 and in the morning I'm making wafflez

       perfectionist
   @DallasTWD aye quite a #perfectionist, tis why his work turns out so fantastic. Aside from learning under the great Romero.
   @lovesflanery @horserider2012 yeah, I can only imagine that it is not easy. Although who knows. Maybe Atlanta's the next Orlando?
       love
       modesty

   @phoboska @lovesflanery @horserider2012 @kevthezombekill I don't know that its safe for others in there. The #gutter is a dark place.

   @DallasTWD sadly your research stopped before you could really experience how #awesome being a #zombie is :)

       dinner
   @phoboska @lovesflanery @horserider2012 @kevthezombekill see that is where you are wrong. I need the pictures in the menu to decide #dinner
   @Infectionde1D done :)
   @phoboska @lovesflanery @horserider2012 @kevthezombekill pictures of donated legs can be sent to... ;)
   @roxigrrl13 haha, always scary movie 6-10 ;)
   @HendleyX rabbits are hard to digest, but I survived on the lesser mammal, barely.
   @breemariebaby thanks my dear :)
   @phoboska @lovesflanery @horserider2012 @kevthezombekill sounds like I have a few volunteers for the leg donation :-).
       rocking
   @roxigrrl13 would be #rocking. The future always holds wonderful new surprises. :-). Hope all is well out your way.
   @roxigrrl13 aye, thanks my dear. Easter was .. Delicious :-). I love holidays where stew comes delivering :-)
   @phoboska @lovesflanery @horserider2012 @kevthezombekill yeah, see, had to book tickets, set up pet care, eat a small child and off the legs
   @Horserider2012 @lovesflanery cool, then you already probably have a line in. Brilliant
   @HendleyX meh, stumble around a bit, eat flesh, spend time wondering where the hell it went after my stomach, then repeat ;)
   @breemariebaby @maggiegrenetwd well my precious that is depending on if she gets the chance. Could just lop a piece off as I need :)
   @_WalkingShane thanks for the Rt
   @vixion83 my little one drove me to Texas, over the phone. Apparently she wants to see @doree_anne too lol
   @MjdoyleTwd thanks for the Rt :)
   @breemariebaby I know when I get the call. Still a it away from starting to shoot. We'll see
       Daryl
       badass
   @spl132db he'll do what is necessary, no hesitation. #Daryl strong at 13-14? #badass in the making.
   @AlessaYwengaard I like the gov from the comics, he is much less redeemable. This Govey is soft in comparison.
   @HendleyX hey there how ya been?
   @Horserider2012 @lovesflanery @phoboska @kevthezombekill not a super long drive, although you may run into trouble with getting on set.
       lucky
   @breemariebaby #lucky you Maggie, you have a very good friend apparently
   @vixion83 being a mom is like 80000 jobs rolled into a bundle of cuteness.
   @lovesflanery @dinelle_fuller thank you folks, it means a lot :)
       rick
       loss
       poorly
   @Horserider2012 Govey's secret to Milton tells a lot. He is no different from #rick taking #loss very #poorly.
   @spl132db idk, I think he's moving in a direction towards better survival skills. He is learning what it takes in the new world.
   Dear @netflix\nWhy put foreign movies without subtitles up on your US server? You know we are lazy here and only speak English.
   @Horserider2012 @lovesflanery @phoboska @kevthezombekill cool, awesome b-day.
   @MaggieGreneTWD you don't REALLY need that little one do ya?
       spring
   @vixion83 #spring madness strikes us all.
       bite
   @MaggieGreneTWD so how bout, can I have a #bite. Been a while since I had some raw flesh, perhaps but a finger?
       truth
   @Horserider2012 aye, thank you my dear. #truth you speak. Until the finale, Ricks hands were dirtier than Govey's.
       zombie
   \u201C@MaggieGreneTWD: @whart31 Haha! Yes. Brilliant!\u201D And they say brainpower is lost without oxygen. See, it's not that bad being a #zombie.
   @lovesflanery @dinelle_fuller had a few rough days, but we'll live to fight another day, lol.
       bitchalert
   @spl132db I'm glad she's leaving him alone, she pushed Rick to become what Carl is now becoming. Then got mad at him for it #bitchalert
   @vixion83 I'm surprised a bit at how easy she got off. Govey was a puss till everyone was ready to call it. Then he showed his anger.
   @vixion83 yeah, things are much calmer. Thanks. How bout you?
   @lovesflanery @horserider2012 @phoboska @kevthezombekill @samanthag2016 @dinelle_fuller two with axel, but he barely said hello :(
   @lovesflanery @horserider2012 @phoboska @kevthezombekill @samanthag2016 @dinelle_fuller I'm glad I only lost one fave this season.
   @Horserider2012 @lovesflanery @phoboska @kevthezombekill @samanthag2016 @dinelle_fuller oh yeah? When ya coming?
   @lovesflanery @horserider2012 @phoboska @kevthezombekill @samanthag2016 @dinelle_fuller ain't that the truth

   @TexasgirlBobbie maybe twice for desert life
   @TexasgirlBobbie what you see for up and out growth will be that same in he dirt (balance) repotting is necessary, as is daily watering
   @TexasgirlBobbie just need to make sure you have enough air getting to the roots, also as a youngin, they are relatively quick growing
       farm
   @TexasgirlBobbie this is it's 3rd year since I took the clipping from one of my favorite trees at the #farm
   @TexasgirlBobbie Darn thing grows so freaking fast it's really hard to keep managed. I'm still focusing mostly on trunk formation over shape
   @vulturekiss as a kid it took 13 scouts hand in hand to get half way around it ;-)
   @vulturekiss I totally wasn't kidding when I said I dig trees. If let go that tree will get MASSIVE. We have a couple white oaks like it ;)

   @Sugarass_REEDUS @netflix Judging by the lack of reply from Netflix, they don't monitor their Twitter very well and won't be likely to add.
   @Sugarass_REEDUS @netflix Looked up the Wiki on The Wave, looks pretty darn cool. Gonna check netflix to see if it's there.
   @Patty_1125 That's Olliver, my ex's dog, actually. She ditched him, hell the cat was her's too, bought after she left *rolls eyes*

   @liane810 Also on what you dun did ;-).
   @TexasgirlBobbie She let one rip the other day that had me tearing up it was so bad. thought I was going to die.
   @Patty_1125 which one, big or little :P
   @liane810 Idk about that, there IS a woman's prison after all. ;)
       boobs
   @liane810 ;-) sure about that :P. the one thing I wish is i could show a little shaft and get outta tickets #boobs rock for that
   @liane810 But you already have that deal as a woman ;-)
   @TexasgirlBobbie Believe me, i would know about that one... That girl can clear a room, you have no idea.

   @Galfriday70Ruth lol, I said they HAD to be uncomfortable, she said they were incredibly comfortable and wore em for a few weeks straight.
   @_manyofhorror @jfaras66 I mean, yall figure that out between yourselves. I'll go along with whatevs :p
   @Sugarass_REEDUS Ironically, having done MUCH worse to the native americans to start OUR sordid history.
   @Sugarass_REEDUS I have not, hope @netflix has it, although considering the histories between our countries... I'd imagine they wouldn't
   @Sugarass_REEDUS Been hitting the @netflix foreign horror section. Perhaps if we request additions to their twitter they will respond??
       twdfamily
   @Sugarass_REEDUS Rambock (sp?) Berlin Undead was pretty darn cool. Loved that movie, hence reccomending it to my #twdfamily
   @Sugarass_REEDUS Was a really nifty perspective to see a film that wasn't denigrating to women, don't get that much in this country.
   @HendleyX @Horserider2012 international, cool. What part of the world do you hail from?
   @HendleyX @Horserider2012 what level are you in school?
   @jfaras66 he a fish tank display, dig it haha
   @HendleyX @Horserider2012 Much nicer than mine ;-)
   @HendleyX Ahh, chemistry tedious subject to learn, but REALLY freaking cool.
   @HendleyX Actually... I do go to school ;-). Classes start back the 10th of July, so close. I'm a science guy, it just makes sense to me.
   @Horserider2012 now that WOULD be intense. Also, I have no freaking clue how I would even begin to keep up with that :P

   @Beloved31075 @vixion83 idk if I trust medical staff after that. $15k is a lot to pay to not get any treatment\/answers.
   @vixion83 @beloved31075 may be what it was, was just gone one day. Didn't really realize till mud way through the day.
   @vixion83 @beloved31075 supposed to be worse pain than child birth
   @Beloved31075 the brightest joy of my life, even if mommy and I aren't so good together.
   @Beloved31075 that's what I was feeling basically. I spent a full 24 hours in fetal position trying not to goto the hospital.

   @Beloved31075 every test they had, no freaking clue #voodoo.
   @Beloved31075 so does Siri, usually the ones I spelled right into something stupid

   @Beloved31075 still clawing my way out of a medical bill. They ran tests, just couldn't tell me what was wrong. Thought appendix initially
   @Beloved31075 never give up, never surrender bet you'll NEVER say \get a job\ to someone in a worse predicament. Super hard to get back up.

   @Miosotis83 @cagraham68 Jesus is an allegory for the Sun. The bible is based off of 15 other religions that predate it.

   @Miosotis83 @cagraham68 I also don't share the #religious background that encourages that.
   @Miosotis83 @cagraham68 I think that's a uniformly bad choice. Sex should never first come at marriage, would suck to be stuck with bad sex
       convinced
       right
       bets
   @Miosotis83 @cagraham68 yup, now I'm #convinced I was #right. You just need the right man to come along and all #bets are off.
   @cagraham68 @Miosotis83 case and point.
       HumpDay
   @LittleCatToo thanks my dear, hope your #HumpDay rocks too.
       love
       hugs
   @Miosotis83 @cagraham68 mmm #love me some good #hugs :)
       designed
       hide
       tent
       excited
   @Miosotis83 @cagraham68 y'all definitely are #designed to #hide it better. I mean we walk around with a #tent if too #excited.
       ladies
       predators
   @cagraham68 @Miosotis83 see, human nature tends to have us all yearning for more in that regard. #ladies especially, y'all are #predators
   @Miosotis83 @cagraham68 I still hold to my stance.
       convinced
       great
       poker
   @Miosotis83 @cagraham68 uh huh... You almost had me #convinced. #great #poker face ;)
   @DeathbatWalker Atlanta :)
   @NurseNikki808 probably not too much longer, why you ask?
   @NurseNikki808 depends on the night
       initiates
       roll
       never
       wanting
   @Miosotis83 @cagraham68 if he #initiates and you just #roll with it, but #never put out, it keeps him #wanting.
   @DeathbatWalker you coming out November for the @WalkerStalkers con?
   @NurseNikki808 finals next week. Working my last research project tomorrow draft due Thurs, then final studying. Yayo
   @cagraham68 @Becca_Turner24 hehe yeah, I miss those days.
       love
   @DeathbatWalker filling my head with hot air before bed. #love it :)
   @cagraham68 I mean the boss that flirts with you. Don't actually ever do anything, just get a little flirty back ;)
   @Becca_Turner24 @cagraham68 I can only imagine
   @cagraham68 work hard and find the flirty boss and roll with it. Remember you possess orbs of mind control :)
   @cagraham68 @Becca_Turner24 around 11 lol
   @DeathbatWalker you are too kind :)
   @cagraham68 at last you off the unemployment bs.
   @Becca_Turner24 @cagraham68 right? 8 am has been sleeping in for too long
       hell
   @anndamico1 it has been ages, how the #hell have you been?
       ate
       bad
       hippie
   \u201C@Sami8585: @whart31 haha look what I found! http:\/\/t.co\/vx0YH1a9Wr\u201D I was sleepy, #ate a #bad #hippie prior. :)
   @cagraham68 It was glorious, I actually slept in :p
   @BakerReedus I cannot be held responsible for what happens when I get REALLY flippin hungry :)
   @Reedus_Therapy I just might :0

   @Horserider2012 grown sooooo much
   @Lilwickidz he beat up the dogs as a 1\/2 lb kitten. Mind you my dogs are 20 and 65 lbs respectively.
   @cagraham68 it was a wild night lol
   @badass_greene tis how he got his name, dog ran him over once, he bounced up and attacked the dog's tail, as soon as he got in the house.
   @badass_greene when he was a palm sized kitten he would brawl with the 20 lb and 65lb dog. Still does, but the size ratio is changing.
   @badass_greene it is, he's a friendly little bastard.

   @Alexes_Writing lmfao, so the video turned out meh. Tis rather dark to be shooting video without night vision. gonna take a bit post.
   @Alexes_Writing checking the video now. He didn't flip out like I had hoped, however he did move to pass out on the other side of the car...
   @Alexes_Writing I tried to set my camera up to take video, didn't look so great in test shooting. May or may not be able to post :p
   @Alexes_Writing my thought too, lol... Turning lights out and prepping to launch :)
   @Alexes_Writing the question is, do I use a water balloon, black cats, or my car alarm to mess with him? Yes, I'm prepping my camera ;)

   @ToriDT73 so far, just ladies who've tried it. Apparently I picked pretty well for my experiment day.

   @ToriDT73 if you're lucky.
   @ToriDT73 just realized last night that my pizza stone fits in my grill
   @ToriDT73 doing a few new things this round (dough will be ready in ~45 min). Wood fire, brains, lamb, mush and spinach
   @ToriDT73 lol, ideally I WANT it to look like brains on the pizza. Smoked seems to be more brainy than the other methods I tried.
   @Reinbeast I do ;)
       zombiePizza
       lambBrains
   @ToriDT73 so... I'm creating a recipe for #zombiePizza... It contains #lambBrains. Smoked lamb brains... http:\/\/t.co\/UUv7pkoWFv
   @ToriDT73 it engages more senses. Ex. When you don't order fajitas, but hear the sizzle and smell the still cooking meal as it goes by
   @ToriDT73 get your ingredients from your local farmers market. Better ingredients = better end results. Pick ingredients for color variety

   @ToriDT73 made the dough and sauce from scratch. All seasonings were also of my own blending :)

   @Dinelle_Fuller @DenverComicCon @Michael_Rooker and @ChandlerRiggs will be there too. You should come out and say hello.
   @Dinelle_Fuller @DenverComicCon two weeks till the con :)
   @Dinelle_Fuller did some photo double\/stand in work during the semester, will be back after gigs after @DenverComicCon
   @Dinelle_Fuller yes, it does. Research skills are invaluable :p
   @Lynsonya69 that would be no bueno
   @Lynsonya69 @Horserider2012 @DenverComicCon loads of caffeine
   @Lynsonya69 @Horserider2012 @DenverComicCon or stay up till 5am :p
   @Dinelle_Fuller especially since I pulled the actual state law and showed it to her. No denying she knew she was in violation now. ;)
   @Dinelle_Fuller still don't have access to her school or medical records, which goes against state laws of Indiana.
   @Dinelle_Fuller still a LONG way to go, probably only reached through a lengthy battle in court.
   @Dinelle_Fuller she's happy as ever. More so since mommy's playing nice currently.

   @tracybaird_1970 @Mayham_Kevin right on the other side of that bridge going INTO Ky there is a road sign that almost killed me from laughing
       beautiful
       daughter
   @Mayham_Kevin @tracybaird_1970 my #beautiful #daughter and baby momma live in Valpraiso
   @amandasl1991 @teia44 it sure is, albeit hot and humid
   @tracybaird_1970 @Mayham_Kevin I mean, cheap lawn service through their customers, they ALWAYS say hello, catch my dog when he runs off.
   @amandasl1991 @teia44 lol, lucky for me and you ladies I know a lot more than that lol

       broken
       truck
   We have now #broken into my #truck and retrieved the keys without any lasting damage. Woots
   @tracybaird_1970 @Mayham_Kevin stinks less than any idiot with a thin metal rod being able to get into your car ;)
   @tracybaird_1970 @Mayham_Kevin mine are a bit better than that, but still very difficult.
   @Mayham_Kevin @tracybaird_1970 I think it's like 3-4 for a door only key, more for drive too
   @tracybaird_1970 @Mayham_Kevin lol, I have the nicest crack house people ever across the St. Weird right??
   @amandasl1991 @teia44 I don't know where else I'd be, gravity prevents me from flying in the clouds ;)
   @tracybaird_1970 @Mayham_Kevin doesn't work on cars that were made after they started putting a bar in to prevent slim Jim's from working
   @amandasl1991 @teia44 I'm sure we'll cross paths eventually.
       winning
   @Mayham_Kevin @tracybaird_1970 shoulda been able to do so with my folks, but they didn't answer, or call back #winning
   @Mayham_Kevin @tracybaird_1970 yeah but a spare key in a magnetic box is so much more practical, and less likely to get knocked off
       trade
   @tracybaird_1970 @Mayham_Kevin basically lol, I don't live in a great neighborhood, but can walk to school. Good #trade in my book

       tequila
   @dholifield for tequila I'd send you to Tucson, Az anyways. Best #tequila menu i've seen anywhere ever. Trying to remember the bar's name
   @dholifield I am actually on the road moving to your coast. Gonna finish off my schooling in Washington state.
   @dholifield Bingo, same theory. Molasses rum has it's place (rum and coke and many mixed drinks) but is the sugary death hangover maker.
       trolls
   @Dodge and here I was hoping that @Dodge was smart enough to check social media for #trolls of dissatisfied customers.
       love
       booze
       thousands
   @dholifield gotta #love how good #booze brings folks together, even across #thousands of miles :-D
   @dholifield if you're a rum guy and they have Pyrat, I highly recommend that or 10 cane, both sugar cane rums, molasses is inferior rum
       pyrat
   @dholifield honestly I pick Espolon over Patron, then again Patron imports one of my favorite rums #pyrat
   @dholifield and better than many of the $30-$50 bottles i've had.
   @dholifield siri always wants to help, that's the one. Their reposado is one of my favorites and rings in at ~$20. WELL worth the purchase.
       GreatJob
       replace
   Here's to @Dodge for making their warranty end three weeks before the product breaks. #GreatJob ensuring that you don't #replace the part.
   @dholifield so Tell me this... Espalon respota, dig it or never tried it?

   @blackroomsec Kali being my only installed Os, the fix bit becomes higher priority than if I was just running VM.
   @blackroomsec Sweet thanks. Apparently the Dradis in my latest install works just fine. Lol
   @blackroomsec Lol, yeah I'm getting much better st fixing it lol. Lol
   @blackroomsec In fairness, it's been at least 8 months since I played with attempting to get it running properly.
   @blackroomsec It worked, till a serious update from mother ship then nothing. Was still in the noobly stages of my learning so I wasn't equipped to debug
   @blackroomsec It's been a minute since I tried messing with Dradis, just got into magic tree instead. Worked with my style so I let it fly
   @blackroomsec I've found it to be hit or miss with Kali. Half the time I can't even get it to start up. I've mostly used magic tree because of such

Tell me again how banning guns will keep crazy people from going on sprees and I’ll call you a liar.
Jen RockeyTruly don't want to get into another politically fueled debate, however, notice this took a group? That right there is rather unusual, yeah? How many of these have happened? Just curious, also, pretty sure MOST people don't want an outright ban on all guns, some probably, all definitely not. Pretty sure the general consensus on what is wanted is simply stricter regulations, heavier and more enforced punishments for not following those tighter restrictions, and bans on some of the more lethal types, which I won't list or get into because for gun nuts it's a HUGE debate. I also don't think there is any single one person out there that truly believes stricter gun control will stop this type of violence in it's entirety. This whole it's alllllll the way one way or allllllll the way another childish arguing is what's keeping us from moving forward. Just my 2cents today

Happy bday lovely lady. Hope it rocks
folks, please take this seriously and fight back against those that want to take the free and open internet and twist it for their own gain.

I really resent entitled man boys, but more importantly sociopaths, equating out to the “men shouldn’t ___ do these things.” Men do not do these things, we have respect and self control. Sociopaths have no care for anyone else’s emotions. Hopefully the corrupt system sees it through to the end and nails this sociopathic asshole to the board.
#shameful
Long fucking night holy shit. Most of this was before 6 am. Coma coming now. Yay graveyard shifts.
Love my PayPal, better than ANY bank I’ve been with.

And what a fucked up journey that turned out to be lol
Hehe
And it’s because of that large percentage we are seeing polio outbreaks, etc.
Jason HooverWhere is polio been reported?! Are you serious?!
Jason HooverDid some research and apparently Syria and Congo have some but the articles said it was vaccine derived.
Jason HooverPlus since the vaccine inserts say that they can actually cause autism I'm sure that's why lol
Jason HooverI saw it on the insert lol

Asleep this year. Had work at 3am. Was stoned as fuck when I passed out though hehe
Folks, the past couple weeks have been crazy. I no longer live in COttage Grove, the chickens all have a happy home, ducks too, Gypsy took the trip to the vet pet owners dread AND I moved 100 miles away to Portland. Today was first day of work at my new store. What a trip that was. All for the better, the last house really sucked and the landlord wouldn’t fix a damned thing. Also, happy belated Halloween. I had my first day of the new store at 3am so slept like a boss.
Jessica Mooney WinterSorry you had to lose your animals but I'm glad you're doing better

Too good not to share
News of the strange after dark
Ro Hawk Garcia shared a link to your timeline.
This morning I heard the president allude that a 64 year old white male from Nevada was part of ISIS. Let's set some facts straight. Yes, ISIS claimed responsibility while hiding in their caves. However, the FBI agent in charge of investigation stated in a press conference, “We have determined to this point no connection to an international terror group.” At least today was the first time I've heard someone not brown earn that title. Let's be real, us white folk have been terrorists throughout history, killing, pillaging and taking advantage of every culture we have ever contacted. Probably why we have no cultural history to celebrate like the rest of the world.

If you're still in Florida, pack you bag and GTFO already. I hope some of my Ga folk can chime in and give some references as to where to go. Please y'all... do not wait any longer, just go, stay safe and see what's left when you come back.
Thanks to whatever god, god's, or Desmond saw fit to give us a little rain. 😈💕

At least he didn't follow Mr "we only shoot black people's" suggestion but god damn this makes me sick to be from that state. Soooo much racially negative press.
Punt puppies.
Fuuuuuuuuck. So glad we saw it before it burnt down.
Not ok... tranquilizer darts are indeed a thing and a better call than killing an endangered species.
Man it would be so cool if the people forgot about Joel's greed and selfishness in the wake of Harvey. Muslims showed better grace than this prick. Hell is in the future of this man who is tasked with teaching morality. It's a shame so many fools choose to see this morally bankrupt individual as a good choice. A fool and their money, right Joel?

Woots, got a solid IDS/IPS (Intrustion Detection System/Intrustion Prevention) up and running after lots of work.
	
I know y'all miss your news of the strange.... now you too can start conversations in poor taste at tonight's dinner.
still true :P
got a call from a "telemarketer" with a promo because of my Amex card (which I don't have) so of course I got curious and asked what company they were with and immediately got put on hold. The next "rep" name was "Moses" and he spoke MUCH better englidh. When asked the same question, I got hung up on.... Phone phishing at it's worst. Also, please note that if you get a call from a "company" you seriously should consider it just that till they prove otherwise. Step one ask "what company are you with?" Step two, tell them politely, "now isn't a good time for me because (excuse), what number can I call you back on in a few?" If it's actually a company you know, they have a number. Otherwise expect the same treatment I got :P
Happy bday girlo. Hope it rocks
Lol, only about half the time I've known him. Hope all is well duder.
Yes I was
Happy bday girlo
Took a bit of digging to find a legitimate source to back the tabloid's piece, but this happened in Oregon recently. Seems innocuous, but I'm pretty sure it's constitutional validity is seriously lacking.Thoughts?
Can we put it to vote and have it carried out when it succeeds, the entire lot of them.

It's like that for sure lol.
Now with one less idiot to try to make assignor comments about how the presidency is not failing miserably.... more on the fail presidency.
Lol, showing how wrong you were voting for him. Literally the most fail president of the last 70 years (as long as we have record of polls).
Happy bday duder
Good morning Y'all
Emily XanthullMorning
Man has it been a crazy day/week holy shit. In one week from a promotion, I'm one of two in the running for another one as of today. Wootsville
For anyone I know that went to regionals or nationals ... You factually have become part of the problem. With our environment in such peril, PLEASE stop taking part in these events. You are factually destroying the beautiful places that are chosen for these events. Anyone I know on council, you should be old enough to still remember that once Rainbow family stood for something other than an excuse to take drugs in the woods. Please remind the new generation of the morality and ethical nature of the origins and honor your brothers and sisters who got their ass kicked to make peace instead of hate. Only through example can any good be accomplished.
You were saying.
Yeah, but only cause they figured out how to still arrest the little guy and give it directly to the giant companies that already are screwing us.
For once, god and I agree.
Yup... get him. Let's see the just-us system change for a little justice. Hopefully the ball keeps rolling afterwards.
Inappropriate considering we still consider church and state as supposedly, and falsely so, separate.
Think your password is secure, think again. Security analysts have evaluated the encrypted passwords from major data breaches (LinkedIn, MySpace, Adobe and as of last month a 68 million user strong breach of Dropbox) dumped to Pastebin by utilizing the same cracking tools the hackers that stole the data would use. What they found is that the typical user failed to setup strong passwords, or utilize them correctly. Check out my blog to learn how to quickly and efficiently audit your own practice, as well as build yourself a very strong password.

No more boneitis guy. Lol. That was short lived. Guess his wife filing for divorce due to the appointment wasn't ok by him lol.
Gonna have to go back here soon. Perhaps this week/weekend.
Think your online passwords stand up to new modern standards? Considering all the data breaches from major companies (LinkedIn, MySpace, and last month a 68million strong account dump from Dropbox), and how many of the encrypted passwords security professionals were able to crack in little to no time, the likelihood of having chosen a strong password is pretty low. Don't believe me? Check out my blog and audit your own password security. By the end of the article you will have all the tools you need to become part of the limited number of folks currently using strong password building techniques.

Finally getting my business started up, so glad I found your Os and rekindled an interest in hacking. Admittedly when i was playing with it often last was when the internet came out as a kid (10-12). Let's just say through my childhood ignorance it didn't dawn on me the numbers i could literally just guess and get through a registration portal was more than just lucky number guessing. Found out fast when the Feds called my folks. Through my stupidity, I learned a lot and am now glad to always be challenged by being the underdog. Still coming after your certification at some point. What better way to be fully equipped for the line of work. Looking forward to getting to that point.

After a long night of editing and building, my blog is ready to launch. If you think your password security is being utilized to it's greatest potential, why not follow along my blog post and give yourself an audit to check how right you are. With the high percentage of passwords that are easy to crack, the likelihood is, your's doesn't stack up either. See for yourself
Oh this looks interesting
Newfound respect for a band I'm not sure I'm familiar with. 😜
Reality check, white people have ALWAYS been the terrorist. That's why we don't talk about our proud cultural heritage of screwing people in shady deals, cheating our treaties and murdering them for either religilous or race reasons.
Excited to say that I have nearly got my first blog post in the last revisions before full release. Prepare to learn how to audit your own password security, quickly and easily. Many of you will likely find out that a hacker can break your password in about 10 seconds. I could not encourage you more to follow the instructions to learn how to significantly increase the strength of your password. Though cracking is still possible, a good password would take the best computer way too long at too high of a resource eating process for a hacker to consider. For obvious reasons, you want to be among the small percentage of passwords that count as such. When final revision is complete, you'll find the link on my social media first.
Good luck arresting me from the US... mocking protest now engaged. y'all must be way in the piss to think it'll go well.

Lol, what a surprise that woulda been. Just wow
Good job Mr Potus, endorse unconstitutional behavior by the people tasked with protecting us. Innocent until what?

Little reality folks... Trump is still lying.
Omg this is too good.
Yup, real heroic being a coward.
One of those weeks all goes my way, starting with a promotion and continuing with the first bitchslap to he landlord's thought he can evict me to avoid giving adequate heating an actual roof, dealing with the broken septic system that leaked for three days unchecked and in cleaned and finally the arsenic poisoning in the well at over twice the legal limit. His eviction was overturned today and I was awarded prevailing party fees. My turn now asshole, lawsuit inbound for a full out spanking.
Here's your morning dose of news of the weird.
I blame Trump for this shit. Seriously? Who else but a Trump would struggle with the concept?
First mistake, trying to send some yay god shit to the obvious person on your list NOT to. Second mistake the following interaction. Ps.. extra fuck you to these two.
	
Worst president ever in the 6 month approval polls. Seriously America, those of us with a lick of sense told you why he was a terrible choice, why insist on shooting yourselves in both feet?
The dumb didn't fall far from the tree
Hate to say it, Phelps lost mad respect for racing a CGI shark while stating he would be racing a shark. There was no fucking shark asshole, you raced yourself or are you so stoned you thought you had a shark with you?
Day of sickos on my feed apparently. If you live in the area, keep an eye out.
Think real folks.
What I want to know is why idiots still go to these fools to learn morality. Clearly the morality of the church is a disgrace. If your moral compass needs these folks to tell you how to be a "better" person then you got it real bad.
Great article.
News of the strange...
Happy mother rotation around the sun to you. Hope it effin rocks
Liked him before... but damn this ups the anti.
Holy shit man
Super cool
The next time someone tells you drugs are bad, throw this in their face 😜
Again, good job to you idiots that thought he was a good choice. How much more tacky can you be than to push a political agenda on children who will now receive a more than sub par education thanks to your budget cuts. #getHimJohnnyDepp
So for any idiot that thinks that Muslims are out to kills us here in the states, let me give you some numbers to think about. In this country there are 326,629,415 people in the United States, and 1.8 billion Muslims. For those struggling to keep up, that's a 5.5 Muslims vs every citizen in the states. In other words you're retarded, we would loose if they really were out to get us. #wakeUp.
For you fools that though this was a good idea, we've paid him over $100,000 for the job and he's literally accomplished nothing major other than loosing support and tweeting. Yup, you helped elect the nations clown.
Seriously, invest in your kid's future with a fun game that teaches a VERY valuable skill that adds to ye olde resume for the rest of their
If it weren't for sick fucks like Brock Turner I might suggest this tactic.
Seriously???? Fuck you America, quit allowing these piece of shit cowards to get a gun. Fear for his life from a 95 year old man, you sir are a pussy and a half.
Wow...
This is what happens when you believe Trump spouts facts.
Lol, what I wanna know is why these guys who have loads of money choose a public bathroom rather than a hotel.
Let's get some thoughts on this one.
Welp, I have a new found respect for this guy.
Yup... so this happened
Hahah, priceless.

We already have cowered to a "zealous ideology that demands subjugation without compromise," it's called Christianity and it's only the domineering religion because they had better ways to kill other societies they met first.

My rebuttal is, would you NOT be pissed if the only people that had money around you were the ones selling your country out to foreign investors that only care what they can leach from the lands supposed to give you life, even at the expense of the way of life for you, all your friends, family and mocked everything you held as a precious life centering belief?

If you answered no to my rebuttal and hate Muslims... you're also a liar.
He hates this man lol

This guy came up to my front porch near the Saginaw store. When I told him tweakers were not allowed on the property he became irate screaming things like "I'm not a tweaker," and "I'll come back and steal all your shit. I looked through mug shots from this year and found him. Keep your eyes out.

Happy bday duder. Hope it's a kickass day. Don't work too hard (like that's possible 😜)
So much this. Look up the standards for "free-range" chickens, it's appalling. To be counted free range with a warehouse of 1500 chickens they must simply have the OPTION of going outside. I.e. One door in the entire building leading out to a tiny yard. Sure maybe 30 of the birds closest to the door MIGHT go outside, that leaves the rest having never felt the wind ruffle their feathers. What I've learned is my babies count as anything I want to call them (free range, organic, etc).
Do this everywhere
So proud of my now big girls.
Happy bday girlo. Had no clue you had moved closer. I'll have to visit or vice versa. It's been ages

Simply terrible what we do to the planet without thinking of the consequences

Proud day for my now indoor chickens, while other local farmers have had a large drop in their egg production, through the coop redesign into the basement we have reached over twice as many eggs as prior to the change... ❤️ to my 🐔, they dropped 1.5 dozen eggs today. #winning.

Ps.
As it is unclear, they still have the huge outdoor run, just sleep inside.

“It is with great determination that I must officially disavow my father’s presidential campaign today,” said Ivanka Trump. “Before this campaign I was not fully aware of who my father was. Looking back now, the things he has said and done throughout his life are totally unconscionable.”

“If it’s possible to know your father and not really know him at all, that describes my situation. My father is clearly not qualified to be president. By now that much should be obvious to anyone with a halfway working brain. If he was a contestant on the Celebrity Apprentice he would get fired in the first week. He is not a smart man.”

These folks all need to call their parents to complain about how much of a pussy they raised.
Does anyone recognize this sweet girl? She was found wandering at the Saginaw store. When I left to go home she was in the road in front of my driveway and nearly got hit on 99. I have her on the run outside my house and my younger dog pestering her to play. The number on the tag is old, I DID get an updated number, but have gotten no reply. Thanks for any help y'all can give :)

Update 6p: this sweet girl's family has been found. Awaiting the call to escort her safely home. Thank you to all who tried to help make this a happy ending (other than my household growing in number lol). 👍👍

stolen cat (Thor)
FREE - Cottage Grove, OR (97424)

Last Saturday my neighbor trapped my cat, as many of you know. He is still missing, though may have been spotted several times near j & m farms on seavy loop Rd where she admitted to having dumped him to the sheriff. I am desperately trying to get my sweet boy back home to his loving family. Please keep your eyes open for my Thor kitty

He is black and white and super friendly.

My neighbor's admitted to trapping my cat and taking him to the humane society, I have called all humane societies in the area this weekend and no cat was brought in. Please help my Thor kitty return home, I fear he was just dumped somewhere.

Edit
I just learned through the sheriff that my cat was not taken to a clinic he was dumped on Seavy loop Rd. Apparently through asking about my cat enough, she called the sheriff herself and admitted to having taken the cat (now liable for the theft) and that she dumped him (animal cruelty). Karma comes, I just hope my cat can be found.

Soooo... I made a post with a picture of Jesus and Muhammad making out captioned 'just gonna leave this here and see what happens.' An old friend replied, 'you are now on an Isis hit list.' Tonight I get hit up from a chick in Roseberg (an hour south), who speaks poor English and is looking for a man... Mmmkay.... When I comment on the poor English and ask where she's from she says Amman, Jordan... Uh huh.... So moral of the story is... She may be right... The question is, am I fucked up for laughing hysterically about this shit?

Dabs from Oregon for my GSU SSDP friends. Keep up the fight, just remember that currently a legalization vote worked in Colorado and has shut down legal businesses like mine in both Oregon and Washington. Vote medical over legal until a way can be found to follow Colorado's law entirely. Thus far it is the only one that has left the new industry to small businesses rather than handing it over to corporate Amerika. Stay high and keep fighting the good fight.
Cutest shit ever

We can thank the late Nancy Reagan for that. Good job, you created the sad police state we live in.
Dude was dead the very minute he picked up guns and encouraged his buddies to have an armed standoff with the government. I highly doubt the wife will see a penny unless her silence is merely to be bought.

#truth organized crime was born of prohibition and our current 'enemies' mostly finance themselves with black market sales. Wanna beat them all in one fell swoop? End prohibition, set quality standards, create safe use areas (stay for the duration) and of course tax it all. Statistically speaking abuse rates will drop (look at countries in Europe with liberal drug laws), death rates will plummet, tax revenue will skyrocket giving more of a budget for idk education, health care, public assistance, etc.
Pwned his bitch ass
Oops

Operation Northwoods hard at work trying to scare the guns out of the people. Remember, Hitler used similar tactics of spreading propaganda to get the people on his bandwagon, then he took their guns and pointed them at the citizens they were taken from and said 'join or die.' Don't let history repeat itself by giving your guns to the government that is responsible for the largest genocide attempt in human history, ours.

Con, working for someone who threatens violence when you tell them that since they smoked all the product that was supposed to be paid at a 50/50 split AND took half your paycheck you were going to stop production and hold the product until full payment has been made. So not deal with this fuck, he's unstable, underhanded and liable to create big problems and have a dramatic blow out.
	
Happy bday girlo
So in reply to taking half of my paycheck and me expecting it back, plus the money I'm owed for the work I've been doing, I got fired and threats of violence on my person. Thank you to this idiot for sending all threats over Facebook, in writing. For those affiliated with Mr Bollinger, I suggest not getting too close as I am the second such incident that I know of. Good luck to him figuring out whatever issues have led him to take a fall like this. Not sure why he would think he could handle a union battle, but best of luck to him.
Happy bday dude, hope it's killer.

Well, I certainly agree with the choice of booze.
Valid point
Imagine that, heroin use goes up after the US invades a country allegedly 'fighting' terrorists who fund their operations via their poppy fields. Bet if we left, heroin production would go down, same as cocaine production did in Bolovia when the DEA was evicted. Don't believe the lies, the drug war and the drug trade are funded by our government in a war against the citizens. Only when their last right has been stolen will many wake up to this reality. Don't be among the naive and don't wait till it's too late to seek facts and become aware.
Just yes

I have long suggested that an involuntary sex change and tossed into gen pop is the humane solution. It ensures he (soon to be she) can never hurt another person like that AND it teaches them the pain they inflicted on their victim. Truly a punishment befitting the crime IMO.

Facepalm
This
How to find out if you have a cool landlord...

Step 1) Name your wifi "FBI surveillance van," "swat team 3," or something of the sort.
Step 2) make your wifi come in and out at odd times, use a wifi boosting, directional antenna to ensure your neighbors pick up this mysterious connection.
Step 3) wait for a concerned neighbor to call the landlord...

You will have your answer when the landlord shows up at your front doorstep to politely warn you that the man is snooping nearby. If your landlord doesn't give you appropriate warning that your wifi is lurking nearby, then clearly they aren't as cool as mine.
Good job.

Copy from the original post by Christine:

"When armed members of a privileged class (in this case, white American males) seize a government facility, as here, they are afforded every courtesy and given the benefit of every doubt. Even the media shows deference to these men by describing them as in such sterile terms as "armed protesters" (think back to Ferguson where unarmed protesters were referred to as "thugs", "rioters" and "looters"). Perhaps what is more telling, though, is the manner in which this interview allows Ammon Bundy (son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, if you recall) to entirely dictate the narrative of this event, casting their actions as a defense of the constitutional rights of citizens and even giving him a platform for a nationwide 'call to arms' to any other 'concerned citizens' wishing to join them.

Now, imagine these men were anything but white."

Hypothetical question… let's say your roommate's cats are peeing and pooping on roughly $1300 worth of your stuff, including two separate businesses, and all over multiple rooms of the house that you you're on the lease for. You ask your roommates to remove the problem cats and get an answer of "good luck paying the bills on your own," what would YOU do?

Sweet, let's endorse international war crimes and see how long our allies wait before attacking.

Super cool

Good for her
Isn't that the truth
Fuck her, fuck him and fuck the police department dirty enough to allow such a thing. This is out just-us systems dispensing its version of 'Justice' yet again.
OMG a group like his needs to start in EVERY town lol
Wonder if brave folks from other precincts will start blowing the lid on the nation wide racist policies practiced by our police.
Learn how you too can fight your cancer without relying on Big Pharma's lies.

Happy bday girlo.
I have a confession to make...
Thoughts?
Day three no cigs... Still no noticeable cravings, apparently the trick to quitting is to get paid well to do so. :)
Truth
Super cool.
Here's how the banking system really works (not just in Canada, but all over the world). Centralized banking is designed to enslave a large portion of the population, help abolish the central bank's around the world.
Just plain wow.
These are the same people who fit in well with society and call society as a whole sick. News flash folks, it's surely not a sign of good mental health to fit in well with a sick society.
I am thankful for the multiple pounds of chanterelle mushrooms in my fridge. Not sure what they will become yet, but rest assured I will find something to do with em.
I gots to say, it may have been a bad day, however the dogs went with me and were 0 problem, in fact it was Oliie who directed me back to the car (before I found my issues). Those that know Ollie, or have been hiking with him, or know him well, (Doree, Naliyah, Thorne, Benjamin, Amanda) know how shocking and relieving it is to see. He is the best behaved little man these days, he is even resisting his urge to violate those coming in the door.
Day 2 cig free and people are lucky that I was stranded in the woods, miles from cell reception, let alone another person for most of it. It was not a good day.
Here's to terrible fucking days.
Day one without a smoke went well, not even a craving. Here we go for day two.
Truth
Well, here goes with my first day smoke free. So glad it's going to be spent in the woods safely away from anyone who may need their head ripped off due to stupidity. Yay for safe quitting practices ;)
Day two of my 5am hour of exercise then hour of meditation self challenge. I'm fucking exhausted...
If the same sad state of affairs is true when I'm old, I will do much the same
Too true.
Lol
Happy bday bro. Hope it rocks
Everyone seems to be well into the holiday spirits.
Yay
This reminds me of my childhood haha
A little dose of reality
Bet their new ones are far better anyways. Family isn't those people you're stuck growing up with, family is the people you choose to keep around as often as possible.

Yup, here we go starting a 30 day self challenge of getting up early enough to have an hour of yoga and workout plus an hour of meditation all completed and breakfast devoured by now... Getting up and starting wasn't the difficult part, now being ready for a nap is. Average new wake up time... 445am.

Everything that gets thrown in your path is your responsibility for it is merely a physical manifestation of what you have going on internally.

I'm eating Swai tonight... Haven't heard of it? Neither had I. Turns out, it's a type of shark.

Caroline BarnetteTechnically is not a type of shark it's more like tilapia
Caroline BarnetteEither way they're usually way over farmed and have crappy ass chemicals in them I worked for a few restaurants that served them and I'll never eat it again
Tammie ParkerI looooove Swai! to me it has this faint bacon taste???
Kevin GalbraithLater itll be some kind of shart and you'll remember why the food chain.
Theresa WatkinsDid it glow? It says iridescent?
Beth VanderbiltLove swai, its very similar to flounder, a white fish, mellow tasting, easy to cook. I worked in the seafood departments of 2 large food store chains, swai is a very good fish, not highly chemically raised at all, I had to attend several seafood conventions as a representative, and learned alot about fish farming and what chemical treatments ( for water) are allowed to be used, and what each specie is fed to maintain a proper diet. Nothing bad at all, bottom dwelling fish & seafood are the only ones to worry about, they (wild caught) end up eating human waste dumped in the oceans and off of barges.

Here's to moving to Oregon where my personal hobbies, cannabis cultivation and breeding, edible mushroom hunting and other wild foraging are viable job skills. As of tomorrow I am a forager on a 1000 acer farm, out hunting edible fungus in the great Pacific Northwest. I also have a 250 acer farm requesting me for much the same on weekends. It's a hard life where 7 days a week I can now go to work hiking in the woods and make booku $ for harvesting glorious edible mushrooms. I fucking LOVE Oregon. Best decision ever to end here.

Hehe
How hemp is currently saving the world.
So I had a thought today. I know a lot of local Eugene/Springfield OMMP groups have been shit down due to Facebook holding issue with cannabis medicine for donation. My bet is this has waylaid more than a few local legitimate business, let alone kept more than a few patients from their medicine. I think it's time we fight back against the discrimination against legitimate businesses and people with legal documentation to support their need for the medicines available for donations. I believe that Facebook has cost medical businesses valuable time and money, as well as costing needing patients their ability for easy access to their medication. That being said, do we NOT have the legal right in a legal state, with legal permits and businesses to take them to court and win one hell of a victory for the cannabis movement? What do my local folks think, time to take back our right to uninterrupted free enterprise and get Fuckerberg out of our groups?
Truth
I predict much of my cannabis will be lost in a series of small fires today... Happy Sunday yall, smoke em if you got em and prepare for the work week ahead :)
Holy shit.

Thoughts on cannabis mead anyone? Thinking of a honey infusion and then leave the plant material in the fermenter to ensure complete absorption. The recipe I'm using will require a year of brewing... Le sigh.
Riddle me this, would yall say that leaving an almost 6 years old in the bath with only an adult on the phone to keep her company? Rhian screamed for mommy for the past 20 minutes in the bath because the water was cold and she needed to potty. If she had fallen, who could I have called ? The same phone I'm talking to my kid on? Bitch of a mother moved out of state without telling me, I just know a general area, what support service would've shown up?

I would like to let y'all know that after speaking with Phil myself there has been a slight misunderstanding as far as he knows. I will be verifying with the owner tomorrow. Bottom line is I will not have my name on a scam and will tell it like it is either way.

What I was told by Phil, the credit check was in and if the deposit had been covered it is possible this could/would have happened. Now, through this the person with the credit is out and so a new check has to happen. It is to his understanding that with the keys, Tink can do whatever the fu k she wants, until someone from the city says no (which they may or may not). So there is truth to a possible zoning issue, but Phillip is under the impression it matters fuck all. He is familiar with the plan wanted me to calm things down here as I delve further. Please be assured that NO ONE is getting ripped off with my name attached without me hunting them down and taking them to the damned station myself. Let's all try to get along for a bit as I look into everything.
This is my preferred method and has been for a while.
Happy bday, miss your crazy ass. Best come visit or some shit homegirl.

One of our big problems in this country is our complete willingness to forget our founding fathers and many successive generations in making this "great" country were committing acts of evil onto the natives that leaves a death toll larger than Nazi Germany. The fact that a history teacher is willingly acting as if it never happened should be a crime, not encouraged to teach lies and propaganda.
For those that have an interest in LEGAL high CBD cannabis medibles (yes they are legal in all 50 states), you may want to consider checking out this indiegogo campaign and donating today. Having had some of the medibles made by the same man, he is a wizard with delicious treats. You won't be sorry if you order more than he can make. :)
I don't miss it one bit :). I can actually get in my car at 4-5pm and get to where I'm going without dealing with a parking lot for a highway.

Vote no Floridians, so far 2/4 states have opted to give recreational cannabis directly to big corporations, while taking all the MMJ jobs and ending them so Big Pharma gets the medicine too. The reality is a vote for legal is a vote to give it directly to the powers that have been keeping it illegal for decades. #voteNoToRecreationalCannabis until and ONLY until we have stopped this trend in the states that have already mobilized towards ending prohibition.

Mommy must still stalk my Facebook, 15 minutes after my last post I get a call, shortly before hanging up Rhian pointed out that mommy was mad at me for calling her mean, the only such implication being put onto my wall. 4 years separated and still childish games and passive aggressive actions. I pity her
Really tired of the childish withholding games from my baby momma. Two freakin weeks in a row my weekly phone call has been refused, not a word in reply. Who the fuck do you think you are to intentionally keep our baby girl from knowing her father. It's truly a pity that Ga has such backwards laws as to allow you to move out of the state, notifying the father of the move 2 weeks later. I'd just now be getting out of prison for the SAME action, you deserve no better. Father's rights are a joke, it's time we look at a total overhaul with more and more men choosing to be a stay at home dad.

So I'm a crazy SOB and climbed up on the wall to take video at Glacier Point in Yosemite. Wait till the very last frame, living on the edge ;)
Fare thee well Yosemite, I will see you again
Here's to sealing the deal with the ex wife's sister. Keeping it all in the family :p
100 miles from Yosemite woohoo
This gypsy's spending the night in Yosemite. Roughly 3 hours out
	
Happy bday lady. Welcome to over the hill :0
Goodbye Arizona, hello California

Happy bday duder
Happy bday ladyface
Happy bday girlo, hope it's an amazing one
Successfully ended a sicko... He had my lady kidnapped for three weeks, under the influence of drugs before I got her free. Her case is still pending due to police negligence, I'm sure they will change their opinion with such a disgusting past history. Lookup the drug Scopolamine, it is the most terrifying thing ever.

#fuckYouOfTheDay goes to a just-us system that would allow this to happen. Cops can break the law to get us arrested, why can a citizen not bend the law to get a rapist busted?
Shocker OLCC isn't doing what they are supposed to lol.
So glad that the Pierce county investigation had a detective that was worth a damn, now if only Olympia would follow suit.

Kudos to this guy
David Williford is official back in jail where he fucking belongs. Enjoy Bunba asshat.
Dig it man, keep up the hard work :)
Happy bday hommie
Climate change is real, no matter how much you believe it's not.
Get it FCUU, set a strong precedence to protect the MMJ industry and our need for legal banking. Failure to allow this is technically entrapment as more than $10k cash in any one person's possession is highly illegal.

Happy bday duder, if you're still working your way cross country I may run into you, bout to embark across the southern states end of the week
Atl folks, my crazy ass will be landing in Atl bright and early on the morning of the 5th. Mission cross country road trip 2.0 is a go. This time the southern route is to be taken to lock down over half the state's driven within a year. :). See some of yall soon I hopes.

This makes as much sense as imposing an IQ requirement to breed. Why punish everyone because someone sufferers from severe stupidity. Stupidity severe enough to cause said retard to kill himself because he didn't know that explosives, plus his head = not a good time.
I know someone like this ;)
This one is perfect.
Aren't I lucky.

Stay out of the arctic you greedy pigs. We don't need you're shitty products, put you're money into getting away from fossil fuels, not furthering our dependence on a destructive energy that is killing the planet around us.
Only way to be :)

They will no longer if seed to sale is allowed to continue. Write to Oregon representatives reminding them that Colorado has the only successful recreational law and you hope Oregon follows suit rather than being suckered by corporate greed like Washington. Recreational legality does NOT mean rewriting pre-existing laws and destroying an already working system. #olccBeGone
Happy bday lady, hope it's an amazing one.
So, any one in Texas or Utah have any Jade Helm experiences yet? For having multiple states as 'hostile' territory, it's been really DAMNED quiet for the 10 days it's been underway. Considering all the hype is figure I wouldn't be the only one wondering what's up.

Brandy KinneyMy ex husband is a mortician and now I don't go to funerals
Soo freakin cool
Can we please put his family up for war crimes already? The money the Bin Laden family and the Bush families both made off of the results of the 9/11 attack would convict ANY one of us for treason, it's time we did the same to those deserving.

So true.
That moment you see a photo posted and are all "damn, who's that?? She's freaking cute.... Ohhhh shit it (insert name of friend's kid you haven't seen in 8 years)." Getting old is a trip lol.
Hapoy bday duder. Hope it effin rocks
A little reality of what recreational marijuana has become now that corporate greed has set its sights on the industry... The fight for cannabis freedom is more alive than ever in Oregon, Washington already lost. Help us put a stop to seed to sale implementation, tweet, blog, post, harass Oregon politicians. Voice out that not just the residents of Oregon are against seed to sale, but the rest of the country is with us. Failure to stop this from becoming a regular deal means that every state that votes recreationally legal will have their medical laws twisted (If they have them).
Please ensure that you pass this information on and look into the seed to sale laws being implemented in Washington. The fight is still on in legal lands, this time to keep the medicine in the hands of the people. Please help us fight to ensure Oregon follows Colorado's lead rather than getting a boner for the corporate shenanigans that will ensue with seed to sale (they are implementing it to MEDICAL as well as recreational). As more states follow suit it is beyond important that the seed to sale trend stops with Washington. Recreationally legal doesn't mean a rewrite of medical laws.
Lol
Hehe
#truth
Help us prevent the local recreation laws from ending up like Washington's. Rec laws are just that, separate from MMJ and have ZERO place changing laws already on the books. Colorado is he only successful rec law so far, why follow the leading recreational Joke and assure a shitty system. Seed to sale will only do one thing, put the medicine right back into the hands of cooperations. FUCK THAT!!!
Happy bday lady, hope it's full of memories that are fuzzy, but musta been fun.
Happy bday lady, have a blastola
Happy bday dude
Hapoy bday dudette, hope it's a great one for you.
Happy 420, have a great time yall :p
Good question.
Kudos to this cop for going to bat, I'm not surprised at a majority of his findings. However, he should try this experiment in New England, I'm betting he'd have a VERY mixed review, as well as more than a few arrests.
Super cool

Folks, next month is the trial for this #monster, responsible for #torturing and #starving #bunnies, #rats, #guineaPigs and #dogs, many of them as a "food source." The animals he was #slaughtering were mostly too #starved to be used for #food. On top of all this, once his face hit international news, #ladies started calling in with #sexualAssault allegations, including his 6 and 14 year old cousins, as well as one of my very dear friends. In his last month before his trial I am trying to raise more signatures on this #petition to demand he max penalty for this sociopath.

By feed the world you mean create poisons that kill the pollinators, creating the inevitability of NO food if we keep you around. Thanks and fuck off, you can to loll yourself now and stop wasting our perfectly good oxygen.
Awww Ga family this is a precious pups.
I'm surprised he made it to court with all the pastors getting moved to Ireland or across the county after paying he family off.
Lol, who knew lifting doughnuts made you inferior to someone who worked out?
Lol, strong argument from a man who's brother took more vacation days than work days while president (exaggeration, but he DID take shit tons of vacation time 879 days total, compare to Obama's 160 days total)

Apparently 28% of whites are complete fucking pricks.
I find it really pathetic how many people cry about #blackLivesMattering yet post Muslim hate, or racist comments on someone less brown with a cry to torture or kill them. Fuck black lives mattering... ALL FUCKING LIFE MATTERS AND DESERVES RESPECT!! End of story. Go ahead and delete yourself if you don't agree.
"Yeah, I may have caused a lot of your injuries by being greedy, I'm sure paying me this outrageous sum will make up for it". What a fucking prick.

Greetings German #twdfans. If yall are interested in an #auction of various rare collectors items, some signed by actual walkers, we are having an auction at the end of the month. Join myself (someone lost a body part because of me), Michael Jaegers and more zombies TBA and get your chance at some rare items. The event page can be found at this link.


If someone could help translate for those who's English is as good as my German I would really appreciate it. Thanks and best of luck with your bids.
For any of my ATL friends looking for a real cool new kitten, there is a litter available, however is closer to Columbus, Ga.
So this implies that women have the right to hit men, so we should have the right to hit them? What happened to "don't hit people?" Kindergarten was so much simpler.
The joy of #eugene is it is perfectly #legal for a woman to be as #topless as a #man. I have also seen a #woman enjoying the lax law in front of #police, no #arrests ensued.

It's a been a minute since I posted this #petition to lock up a sociopathic animal abusing, alleged child rapist. I know many of you have #signed already, but please do so again, we have lost all momentum on the petition and need a burst of new energy.

Folks if you are interested in participating in this auction either contributing you zombie swag or bidding let me know and I'll fire an invite out. #twdfamily this one's for yall :)
Utter bullshit
Last time I bought an unbreakable screen protector, I broke it.
We need to take lessons from this guy
To any of my zombie friend that may have action figures or other special swag they can use, get in contact with me. Working on setting up an auction for rarer items yall might sign :)

Sweet, dig the led setup over the nice hydro beds, it'll be cool to watch this develop further.
Oh shit gundam battle here we come.
Thank goodness :)
For those unaware, one can LEGALLY buy CBD heavy medicines, extracted from the same hemp plant that has been used for decades to legally produce hemp fibers, foods etc. if you are interested in seeing if CBD medicines can help you, check them out.

Alvin, precisely why I call bullshit when I see it and shooting an unarmed man, woman or child, or beating a handcuffed and defenseless person is beyond reprehensible with the level of trust placed on officers to uphold justice and protect citizens from dangers, not increase our danger by their mere presence. That is what we have been told is the reason for police, to protect us from dangerous criminals, not be the dangerous criminals with a free pass.
It's just this simple, he's right. Statistically speaking, in a world with an infinite number of universes, he has an infinite number of possibilities of being right. In other words, he has absolutely 0 chance of winning whatsoever.

Today we embarked on a walk to Walmart to refil our 2 gallon water jug and decided to pick up cans/bottles on the way as Oregon gives $.05 return for recycling them. It turns out that one out of 15 plastic bottles are recyclable because the manufacturer is being uber cheap with their plastic. Anyone else see a BIG problem with that?

Interestingly enough the same right is implemented in to the old piece of toilet paper we call the constitution. At this point the rights that once made our country great are almost bull and void.
The problem with compute security is for every well paid programmer there are hosts of people hurting to make ends meet and far better at getting jobs on the street than with a resume. If the attacker(s) were almost not detected, I'm 99% certain they are just trying to increase the scope of their hack. Take out the #1 security group in the planet and then try to convince me you don't have an army of zombie computers.
We need more of this here :)
Hehe, this makes me giggle. I may have to get my kiddo a Raspberry PI

Ladies let me ask you something, when was the last time you were sitting at the bus station and thought, "hey you know what this looks like a good time to change my tampon. I think I'll just leave it's all nasty one right here on the ground next to the trashcan." Cause apparently SOME nasty bitch had that idea this morning, just walked passed the tampon as proof.
We are giving people wads of money for second grade writing skills and beats made by some underpaid college kid thinking it'll get him somewhere. Seems like as good a time as any to opt out of the idiocy no?

Happy bday kiddo, miss the shit outta you
Yay

And now the placebo effect may have scientific validation. If the lymphatic system connects to the brain then it's not unlikely that believing that the pill will help can create the immune response due to the direct connection to the brain.

That moment when you have proof that you not only served your landlord with a cause to fix habitability conditions, but video/audio of them refusing to sign or read it.

Best stoner spot ever
The joys of being the two people in the house with the smallest footprint, paying the largest portion of the utilities for "non-negotiable" terms. It would be nice if the person running the two large screen televisions and having friends over watching them about 1/2 the nights of the month would own up to the fact that I am paying for their use. One light bulb and a 12" screen doesn't come CLOSE to being the large portion of the utilities.
Depends on the ex lol

Ladies, may you now all drool over the sexiest shit to happen to corsets.
Really? What happened to cannot leave the state?
Bout time we found him
Our government hard at work proving its shitting on its enemies, shitting mother fucking kamikaze drones. Cowards fighting all the groups that cannot really pose a huge valid threat to us, without ever actually having to face them.
Proof that grassroots movements work. Keep it viral, keep the information flowing and keep shedding light of public servant corruption. Those that are large and in charge are scared of us and the rate that change is happening. Politicians are noticing our hard work and starting to back the movement for overhaul of the just-us system. Woots.
Anyone else think this is a crock of shit? Unarmed robbery and breaking and entering are their crimes, seeing their friend shot a pretty strong punishment, doing the time for his death having never had a weapon, cruel and unusual punishment.
Valid argument
Happy bday to the Vortex. :)
So awesome
Think the legal system works? Think again.
Anyone in Va be warned. Pigs hard at work committing armed robbery.
Not Ok pig
End the senseless war on the American population.
Because the bad cops outnumber them 20 to one and will retaliate. #fuckYouOfTheDay goes to The Yakima just-us system. Good job letting a gang member walk while boning the hero that stopped him. Anyone else suspect a judge on a gang's paycheck?
I vote full legal and taxed, lives saved, money gained at a rapid rate, enemies bank accounts dropping as then black market takes a dive. Incentives for illicit manufacturers to go legit, quality standards (less accidental OD due to vastly varying potencies) and safe use areas with medical staff on hand. OD and get a trip to rehab to learn personal control, three strikes and your privilege to be in said safe use areas goes away. $51 billion saved plus all the bonuses to the budget from taxed, previously illegal drugs. Sounds like winning the 'war' on drugs to me.
I swears I'll stop, this article really let me know how dangerous it is ;)
Back to the basics.
Omg this dude needs to go fake cops out lol.

Not a strong platform isolating 53% of polled Americans on their stance for legalization.
There is not enough in this video to make a decision either way. The cop is there already, clearly already talking to them before the phone is pulled out. If he got called because their was a complaint on them, she should have been arrested, if he pushed her for saying "fuck you," then he is in violation of her constitutional right BEFORE he laid hands on her. Without the context behind it one cannot make a strong enough argument either way.
Omg YES
Sarah, while the article does suggest that the authorities allege that he diverted streams, if he is actually harvesting rainwater all he was altering was the drainage basins on his own land so they dumped where he wanted. Hardly the stream diversion you made it sound.

Folks please sign and share this petition to demand the max penalty for David Williford, charged with 12 counts of animal abuse with multiple allegations of rape, including a 14 year old still pending. Please help us ensure this twisted man gets plenty of time to evaluate the nature of his action. Thanks so much for taking the time to help ensure justice is served.
Hello folks of Nottingham Rescue, I am calling on yall help to get the word out and some new signatures on the petition to get this #animalAbuser locked away for the max penalty. David Williford is charged with 12 counts of animal cruelty and is under investigation for multiple sexual assault cases, some involving minors. As the person that made the call to attempt to stop his senseless slaughter of the bunnies and guinea pigs, I have particular investment in seeing his one through. We are loosing momentum in the rate signatures are coming in. If y'all would do me the honor of sharing this petition around in your circles I would be very appreciative. Sign and share like wildfire please and thank you.

Folks please sign and share this petition to demand the max penalty for David Williford, charged with 12 counts of animal abuse with multiple allegations of rape, including a 14 year old still pending. Please help us ensure this twisted man gets plenty of time to evaluate the nature of his action. Thanks so much for taking the time to help ensure justice is served.


Edit: SEATTLE BEWARE, he has moved back up with family and is residing somewhere in your city. Since this report came out and his face hit the news two women have stepped forward with rape allegations, one 14 at the time of the assault. He is not safe to be around, please be mindful of who is adopting the animals.
Many thanks to everyone who have shared, signed and helped make today a day we rose well over 1100 signatures. We are now 413 away from the goal of 10,000 to ensure David Williford sees the max penalty for his 12 counts of animal abuse he is charged with. Please keep up the good work helping to spread awareness by putting the petition in front of your circles. Yall are amazing, love to each and every one of you.

We are safely away and hidden far enough this sicko cannot reach us. Today I was delighted to see the petition to get the max penalty skyrocket with signatures again, 1000 and rising today alone. If you haven't signed it yet please do and make sure to share it amongst your circles.

So touching
Elissa so true
Seattleites beware, David Williford has returned to the area and is currently facing 12 counts of animal cruelty in the first degree for his treatment of the bunnies and guinea pigs he purchased off craigslist. Shortly after he bailed out Kiro 7 ran a piece about two brave women who have stepped forward with allegations of rape, one 14 years old at the time of the alleged assault. I am leaving the news coverage in the comments on this thread and a link to the petition demanding the max penalty. Please be careful with who you adopt out to, you never know what kind of twisted person they might be.

Not the normal posting as the current charges are animal cruelty, however he has had two, maybe three women come forward with rape allegations (I have personally spoken with 3 other victims, my girlfriend is the fourth), one that has come forward was 14 at the time of the incident. I will include the news coverage in the comments. Please sign and share this petition, you will be helping a multiple time child rapist see his due time in prison.

Folks, please sign and share this petition in your groups and circles. This man is currently facing 12 counts of animal cruelty for the starvation and cruel killing methods he used when slaughtering bunnies gotten from Craigslist as 'pets,' claiming the starved animals were for food. Since his face appeared on the news, two women have come forward with allegations of rape, one of whom was 14 at the time. The petition is less than 2000 signatures away from the 10000 needed, please help us keep the ball rolling so this sicko sees time befitting the crime.

I'll believe it, they sided with the criminal stealing my money in Spain.
She just got mad brownie points with me.
So Adam and follower of mine raised a valid point. Our interest in publicly viewable cameras on the policing force only put a crutch on the sword, not the real demon, the politicians shadily putting such barbaric practices into law. He new goal needs to be those involved with upholding the law AND those charged with putting laws into practice.
Bet they know my twisted ex Roomie.

"Belinda Ford Morris has posted a comment to your fund:

"Belinda Ford Morris has posted a comment to your fund:

Karma is a bitch. You didn't help the animals, so no money for you!!"

Umm, dude was in #jail because I tried to stop the #slaughter and how in the world of FUCKALL can you even begin to say rape is "karma?" What a bitch.
Love the festival of colors
I #agree with the #equal rights, however I don't believe many feminists do. Many of them seem to want the reverse of the #sexist system we currently #embrace, which is STILL #sexism.
Lmfao
Actually, we are 18 years away from permanent change to the environment by +6° and the END of all icecaps, glaciers and arctic lands. The probability is unless the animals adapt UBER fast, all arctic species will go extinct. Add in what we've done to the oceans and we likely have an extinction level event coming.

Shakespeare's Garden will be up and running as soon as location is secured. We open with two strains of our very own with two more in the works, one indoor planned for launch in the next year and one outdoor that will take many seasons to have the breed locked down the way we want it. Shakespeare's Mammoth shall take a LOT of work. Let's just say we're shooing for a cannatree with that one. Yall will know when we get it from the photo of someone climbing said tree ;)

We have an unusual situation here and could use any energy, prayers, shares or donations that y'all could help with. We got ourselves involved in a really sketchy situation at the place we moved into after a cross country move. Our roomie was a twisted individual who has made the past two months a very traumatic experience for myself and my lovely lady. We have no place safe to go here in town, all rent money stollen by the ex roomie (news reports included in the link). Any help that could be offered would earn my eternal gratitude and a large load of reiki heading your way. Thank you all, many blessings to you all.

We're nearing our first goal on our path to safety, please share if you cannot donate. Love to you all.

Cali folks, please help save this poor puppy.
Too cute not to share, mini nunchaku master in training. He deff has some good transfers and loads of speed.
Ice-T got part of it right, it is there so we can protect ourselves from tyrannical threats both domestic AND foreign. Giving up that right is simply the people saying they 'give up' and will allow the oligarchy to remain where 'democracy' is supposed to be.
Beginning to feel like a work-o-Holocene. Two interviews set up for tomorrow, like I really NEED three jobs. Good bye relaxation, hello hustle till I drop.
I couldn't #agree more
Damnit I wish they had picked me.
Someone messed up
Ummm, yes.. We shouldn't have to support a bunch of steroid taking morons drug habits while they keep all profits earned.
Happy bday lovely lady, hope it's filled with all the blessings you could wish for.
Pretty freakin pimp.
At least they seem to actually be reaching for the taser now, sadly it's over 0 threat, but still improvement over the trigger happy responses we've been seeing.
Anyone ok with this shit or has it gone far enough?
This is his brain... On drugs... Note it's STILL not a frying egg
Love it, live it, be it
And there is quite the track record to prove it. It was the ease of being created by anyone that killed that bit once the cat got out of the bag.

Cruel and unusual punishment without a doubt.

"You are NOT a sociopath!
What were you thinking? That you are actually a sociopath? You are one of the most sweet, brave and helpful people out there!
You love other people, you always help others, even at a great personal price, and you always (well, almost always) have a smile on your face.
So what are you still doing here? Go and take one of those "What kind of chocolate are you" quizzes!"

ok, so this is just plain damned cool.
#winning get it North Carolina, make the south proud.
This shit scares me as eventually patriotic people will stand up and defend the foundations that made this country great in theory. Eventually the people, or the world will get so sick of the bullshit that there is literally only one way it can go, the second Revolutionary War. The one where the people take back the powers granted them by the constitution and fight the tyrannical force that is oppressing much of this country and certainly the world.
Umm sounds kinda awesome
This is winning right here :p
Omg just simply YES
:P
Smart business practice girls, get em where they're hungriest.
Well I moved out here to launch my own line of cannabis with the two strains I had bred myself. As of today, I am leaving Olympia without my seeds, or plants. Alvin, you ask why I don't trust police officers, I DID get my animals back, yes. However, due to the negligence of the officer who HAD the culprit of animal abuse in the back of his car covered in bunny blood, I have lost my hope at having a business because he choose to NOT arrest the man. A man who I had called the exact same officer the day before to file a report of threats of violence. When I get asked what the police have done for me, the answer is still NOT the job I needed from them, NOR the protection I called them for.
Well this sure explains a whole fucking lot.
Well this could explain a lot

Rhonda Simsxoxoxo
Ahh the joys of seeing a well laid plan executed perfectly. Thank you all for all the well wishes last night, it means a lot in the fucked up world I am in. However my post last night was primarily to cover me gathering the evidence I need to protect and defend myself in this situation. Police have been involved and measures have been taken to ensure my safety after a threat of violence to relinquish my legal right to my place to live and to protect the many innocent animals being starved and denied proper medical care when they are sick, I have witnessed 4 deaths in my stay. Yall were perfect to cover my photographic evidence being gathered to bring this shit to an end. Congratulations, through your efforts what's left of ~20 rabbits and guinea pigs, plus the two little dogs locked in the attic will be saved from the 48+ hours they have had with no food and water or longer will receive the care and attention they need and deserve. Give yourselves a hand for helping me play bawling mess over a breakup while I continued to gather evidence of mistreatment. :)
Enter the police
jackass
Sadly it turns out that so far moving to Olympia has been one of the worst decisions of my life.

--edit 2/5/2015 see to my newer long post, this post's purpose has been served. Thank you all for your love and support.
le sigh, yet another interesting day.
Fucking bullshit ain't it.

"Girl, you are adorable. Now I may not be Mr Right, but I make a great Mr Right Now. How about you throw your abandon to the wind and take a chance with me tonight."

I have been running it as an opener and had incredible success thusfar. Happy hunting gents, please do let me know how your field test go. I foresee a lot of pussy incoming by the ravenous response I've gotten from all tests. ;)

Meet Manresa Castle in Port Towensend, Wa, t is haunted, or so they say. I have been booked for a convention in the town and am staying here, apparently Ghost Hunters or some such TV show came and didn't stay their full bit, having gotten plenty in 1/2 the time they anticipated. The parking defacement SWIM did with a band's sticker he met playing down the way, cool kids. Do I need to say more ths naked lady fountain?

Big thanks to my dad for promising to help me by going to the Ga DMV to get a reprinted title so I can change my tag over to Wa before my tag expires on Monday. Good job telling me Friday night after everything is closed that you're being childish and aren't going to do it as payback. What an awesome bday present loosing the ability to be able to actually perform the duties of my new job. Thanks for giving me the gift of a useless car till I can walk into the DMV myself. #fuckYouVeryMuch.

People should not be afraid of their governance, we outnumber you and your army, probably not a good idea to keep shooting innocent black teens, or teens period. Eventually the kids on the playground gang up and fuck up the bully.
As the masters of our individual sovereignty we are beyond capable of making and informed decision, it's the age of information, I trust anyone that gives a damn to stay safe will lookup one of the 90,0000 safe use guides on the net and the rest likely have much of a death wish so can go ahead and give themselves a Darwin Award honorary mention if they choose, it IS their life after all.

"thank you for your sacrifice and fuck you."
Take it from this zombie, nothing is more freeing that having no fucks to give. Burn the mask and all it represents, if work requires the mask, then you should not be working there. The one thing that everyone should strive for is personal happiness. Of course one must take responsibility for their own happiness rather than look at outsiders to give it to you. If you're waiting for someone to give you happiness, you are likely to wait and wait and wait you're entire life through. Following one's dream is scary, letting go of the societal expectation of working for some a-hole who likely doesn't give a damn about you and is 2000% taking advantage of every employee under him (remember it's only the big boss that makes the real money). Dump the system, leave your misery behind and find a new path following your passion. Sure you will still have your hardships, but when you're living your passion and following your dream, even the low's don't seem as low.
Seriously auto repair shop, "part will be here monday or Tuesday at the latest???" Well I'm still stuck in this damned town, my car still isn't repaired and ya'll can't even be bothered to call me back and let me know what's going on. WTF?!?!?!
Dear feminists,

It's adorable that you are women, many of us men love yall (and hate things about you too). I would like to take a moment to evaluate the "equality" that ya'll fight for which embraces the exact opposite of the shitty system we have now (men over women becoming women over men). It's great you were born a woman, sucks that so much baggage comes with it but nature dictated that, not us. Feminists need to grow up (here's where I'll say it), take a midol and quit playing like they want actual "equality." Chances are ya'll do not want to be included in the draft, start seeing men win in court during divorce and child custody cases, be entitled to pay child support for a child you never wanted (aka not allowed to abort and forced to pay for the mistake as we are) and not given a choice about staying in the child's life (a woman doesn't need a man to make the abort decision, hell many guys probably never know they had a sea monkey for a minute). If you want TRUE equality then you are saying you want to be draftable, are willing to give men a way to "abort" their responsibility for a child (much as we must accept your right to abortion), and a plethora of other bits too. Just saying how does turning the system that has been unfair to you (again none of the men you are bitching at made the system, we're kinda stuck in it too) to where you have the upper hand is any different than the way things are now? I realize that the emotional mind is incapable of rational thought (the heart has 0 capability of thinking, therefore 0 rational thought can come from the emotional "mind"), but put emotion aside and try to think rationally for a minute, what good does it do to cry for un-equal "equality?"

Since there is apparently some folks who don't understand, a joke is just that, humor with little seriousness. I will continue to block those that choose to get bitchy because they don't understand. Carry on then :)
Nicotine is actually the usual first "drug" used.

Last day in atl, ready to drop fron non-stop frenzy packing all day. Happy halloween folks.
Finally got the trailer loaded up so there will be no shift of the stuff back there, allowing the dogs to have their own cabin
Folks, it would appear that all the shelters in the area are full, we have two kittens and a mom that need to go to good homes. As we are about to drive cross country, a lot more possibilities pop up so you're not excluded for not living in the Atlanta area. Seriously, you might be surprised by the vast reaches of the planned route.

“Citizens may resist unlawful arrest to the point of taking an arresting officer's life if necessary.” Plummer v. State, 136 Ind. 306. This premise was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case: John Bad Elk v. U.S., 177 U.S. 529.

This does NOT mean you will win against the injustice system, but it IS the legal precident. He is WELL within his rights to do what he did, IMO.

Exactly why us actors cannot say SHIT about our day on set. This is what you are asking us to risk when you ask leading questions. :-D
Finaly, a slur I can agree with.
The sad reality is we already make it ok for lies to be taught to kids growing up, the government is afraid of the freethinking ideals that came with the 60's and 70's. Do NOT allow such propaganda tactics to indoctrinate tomorrow's leaders with false ideas else we are doomed to repeat our history.
Just proof that America is fucked and has been for a LONG time. Any system that not only allows idiots like this to succeed in life, but to rise to a position of power over the people is clearly sick and damaged and in SERIOUS need of reform.

Monsanto is a potentially responsible party for at least 93 Superfund sites. [23] Four of Monsanto's industrial facilities in the U.S. rank amongst the worst 40% of comparable facilities in total toxic releases.

sounds fun :p
Historically it makes sense, not so much now. Back when the bible was written a couple needed 9 children to ensure one or two made it to adulthood. Men with men, or women with women wouldn't be very good for the continuation of the species. In this day and age we can all freely admit that we are overpopulated, all gay or lesbian couples are voluntarily removing themselves from the problem. Also, stuff like this couldn't be more natural, in times of overpopulation some animals may even have a gender change occur. Plus the mere mention of this in a book that's been around for so long indicate that homosexuality has been around at least through the past 2000 years (as long as religion has been on the planet).
HOLY SOUNDS A BLAST...
Hehe, nice knowin y'all :)
It's been a weird day and a half in ATL. Last night I saw the armored proof of war against American citizens (the military vehicles police now get) and today I see an unmarked car (looks like pkm took the old G prefix on the tag). Plain clothes, plain car, computer access at drivers seat. Watch out ATL, they are getting crafty.

I have seen some interesting studies (link to be posted) that suggest that it is at least a strong avenue to look into. Considering our moment of joining this planet is accompanied with a DMT burst. DMT is a VERY powerful hallucinogen produced in all living things on the planet. What a burst means is that the gland that produces DMT releases it into the blood stream. Yup, that's right, we are born tripping our nuts off. If the moment we were safest in the world (our perception has not yet been jaded) is accompanied by hallucinogenic activity, then it stands to reason that hallucinogenic activity could help regress the patient to a safe place(ish), plus it would be a strong aid to visualization exercises. ;)

Jenna Bird<insert comment about not fighting unarmed persons>? (I MIGHT BE ONE.)

Aidan Wolpinis the answer potatoes?

Aidan Wolpinthe answer is potato
Jenna Birds.i.x. = 3 letters. s.e.v.e.n = 5 letters. o.n.e. = 3 letters. Only pattern I could find. I suck with numbers, but words not so much :)

Frankly I say we end the monitary system that can literally only lead to more war, destruction of the environment and ultimately the planet. Till we can transcend a system where every dollar ever made is taken at a loan that cannot possibly be paid back without taking out a larger loan, ad infanitum.

Check out this fantastic addition to any home.

I heard a doctorial advocate say something to the effect of "It can cure just about anything." I believe the only reason legality is in question is because it threatens a multi-billion $ lie fed to us by the very group elected to see to our well being. Deff don't be afraid to speak out and talk to local representatives and try to encourage them to get the ball rollin in your area, if you are in an area where it IS legal, don't stop sending your donations, just pick specific groups in states still working to effect the change. From a grassroots start we have shown what can be done by people unafraid and working together.
interesting.
lol, strong point haha.
ummmm, durp, first in line bitches
legit use of teargas. lets nail the clearly unarmed woman. A warm FUCK you to the needle dicks firing at this woman.

umm, yeah... THIS
Quit being complacent, bitch loudly to ALL represenetives you can.
Your tax dollars hard at work tear gassing an unarmed and non-resisting black male. Alvin, there is no circumstance when firing on a citizen already cooperating is an acceptable choice. Again, small wonder things escalate like this with the sicko's they allow to wear a badge to "protect and serve" by fucking up an unarmed person.

Media is the biggest danger an officer or the system has, especially when it turns a truthful eye on the sad reality that all is not as it seems. For further research see "battle in Seattle," or "the Miami model." Be aware of your rights and do NOT be afraid to stand up for them.
Apparently Hempfest is this weekend in the Seattle, I bet a lot of marijuanas are injected, this guy would love it.
So I have officially decided that this semester will likely be my last at Georgia State and in Georgia as a whole.

First punch always leads to being open to being lit up, know where to land the blow(s) and it's most deff a one sided fight. FYI, the face is NOT a good first shot, it may hurt, but you head is armored, his/her throat isn't and will drop them to their knees involuntarily if hit. If you have to hit back, make it count.
the entire purpose of #religion is to teach how to #love. Those who use it to shame others or to justify hateful acts against missed the entire point of the beautiful concept laid out in their storybook. None of the religions are historical fact, all are parables (think ASOP's fables) that are designed by humans to impart morality and reverence to one's betters, while also teaching concepts of togetherness. Yes they have different characters, to sell the story, it must have cultural relevance, hense why there isn't one book to rule them.

This man is my #hero. Hunted by the very government he works for, for being brave enough to stand up for the general population's constitutional rights, even though it means he's on the run for his life.
Holy #yum
Alvin, again a clear case of favoritism as any normal citizen would get far worse, PC up or get the shit kicked out of them daily then register for life as a sex offender and have to go door to door anywhere they move. The reason I post is so offences like this get met with the same, if not harsher penalty as the person wearing the badge is supposed to uphold the law, not violently break it. I am not saying "all cops are bad," merely stating that being an officer OF the law, should no longer make the bad ones ABOVE the law. Nor should they use fear tactics to bully citizens unaware of the constitutional rights they have into letting the officer abuse those same rights, illegal detaining to question someone walking on the street, etc. Locking people up needs to no longer be a business, but rather a consequence for those that truly deserve it, the violent offenders. As over 54% of the prison population is in for no more than a drug charge and only about 7% for actual violent crimes, there clearly is a problem, starting with the arrest rates. We cannot sustain this and still pretend to be a "free" country, our percentage behind bars makes up about 25% of the worlds incarcerated people and beats that of any other country, including China where they have the harshest laws anywhere. As a taxpayer, our contribution per person behind bars is $450,000 every year. If you were an officer, you've seen the crappy housing and we both know officers/guards don't make enough so there necessarily must be a huge profit somewhere. As we watch the prison population climb, we also see our education scores drop. Where we used to rank in first, now we are closer to 20th in the world. With minimal change that is an easy fix, end the drug war (estimated cost of $54 billion a year), free the P.O.W's (people in prison for nothing more than posession, paraphanelia, etc. NO VIOLENT OFFENDERS OR THOSE WHOSE CRIMES HAVE A VICTIM). The money saved from the taxes is likely more than enough to fix the issues with the education system ($54 billion + (450,000*person released) and add to federal aid systems to add free secondary education (Bachelors degree education) and strengthen aid for the sick and elderly.
These families are my hero's. One day I hope society can move back towards a sustainable living style where we are one with nature rather than treating what gives us life as our enemy to be destroyed.

Oliver apparently missed his buddies in the pen and has dug out of the fence... I'm going to kill his ass, here we go for another $82 trip as soon as he's found again.
Sums it up nicely Elisabeth, love you :)
I #agree
So full of #win
#fuck these guys and gals
Congrats to DC
Ollie has been found, but due to my ex being primary on his microchip (that the doggy jailers couldn't find), I am unable to get him until she returns their call. Of course it took them over an hour to tell me any if that. #shame on them.
#truth
Haha, well played
Ballsy, but I approve, lol. Anyone wanna drive to DC?
Happy bday home girl, hope it's a rockin one full f fun and excitement.
Hehe
I wouldn't believe it if i hadn't just seen it for myself. I thought they were exclusively fishing birds.
Alvin, this is what I'm talking about. A normal person would be in jail for assault and probably 3-5 additional charges that will only be dropped if taken to trial and the plea bargain is passed up while this officer keeps his job and gets allowed to do it all over again. The consequences should be one and the same.
So fucking true, I swear like a damned sailor sometimes :)
truth
simply beautiful.
Who else #agrees?

Just saw high-speed police chase, how awesome is that?
well shit, it wasn't Ollie... back to making calls n stuffs

Not surprised they felt more comfortable after a therapeutic LSD trip to calm them down. DMT is a VERY intense trip, it is produced in our brains and in all living things on this planet. The most pure moment in our lives is the moment we come out of mommy, we haven't had time to become jaded by the world. In that moment, we are tripping on DMT as the pressure of the skull collapsing down cause it to release. We also die on the substance, another burst comes at the moment of death. Of course psychedelics would aid these people, the drug war is apparently coming to a rapid close.
Dude's pretty funny
seems about what I would expect
And a mule just got killed for forgetting which safe held the goods.

Important information for everyone to know so you don't have your rights infringed upon.
Perk of working for valet, when I do something stupid like lock my keys in my car while in shift, my manager has a lockout kit to "break" back into the car. *facepalm. My spare key is SUPPOSED to prevent this, but I left it inside the car last time I used it so as to not announce to the neighborhood how to get into my vehicle brick free.
Hard at work ensuring you are free to go where ever you want and still be found.
Go Kat go
Valid point, it's my life that will end, hopefully on impact, in the event of a crash, should be my choice to protect myself or be an idiot rather than another robbery at gunpoint.
Holy #awesome.

Happy bday home girl, miss seein you hope all is well.
Gotta love being the scheduled to be the help for the shift I came in early to cover for a sick co-worker. Here comes a crazy run, at the non-stop account today.
Quit giving the gang most likely to take your money at gun point money, don't give them a reason to be able to take it.

Happy bday Dave, hope it's been a great one.
Actually, I'm an ordained minister (crazy right?) that has only officiated over gay/lesbian weddings. Fuck the government, it is a union between a loving couple under the eyes of whatever higher being they choose to give power. Nowhere in that says a damned thing about what some fuckbag who imposes his particular religious belief over everyone thinks.
Tremble before my might :-p

Holy awesome craftsmanship.
Amongst other things. It's sad that because of the awakening that happened in the 60's, many compounds have been unstudied. Take LSD for example, once successfully used as an aid in treating alcoholism AND used to treat childhood skitzophrenia with great success, now demonized as schedule 1 (no known medicinal use). I might also add, cannabis is STILL schedule 1 and PROVEN to cure some forms of cancer, as well as a LOT of other things.
If you get a high enough grade of the vegetable glycerin, it would be possible to make something that worked in your regular nicotine vape apparatus... Food for thought ;)
End the police state, start writing congress demanding they start working towards more peaceful resolutions and less innocent suffering.
So true of Elisabeth lol
Research chemicals are quite dangerous, many sold/made to mimic another high, sold as something they aren't. All a recipe for disaster.

Thank you Mr President, totally a good call. All our system is doing is creating more slaves who's dreams die under a mountain of debt. Education should be a right, not a privilege. We need to follow a European example and make all education free. You'll notice we are falling way behind much of Europe scholastically. This country was made wealthy by those brilliant thinkers who received a good education, failing to include everyone for an imaginary concept like money is just plain ridiculous.
Interesting
some #truth for a Monday
I am more afraid of cops than ANY of the gangs they claim are so dangerous. At least the criminal is going to stop and think, do I really wanna do the time for murder. All the cop has to weigh out is if he wants to do paperwork.
very true
Ummm, yes please.
Good on them.
Lol, my favorite mind of toe :p

I agree. Anyone without a home defense plan is silly. The time it takes the police to respond is plenty of time to get killed and robbed and those responsible be long gone. Be prepared so you won't be sorry (or those that love you).

A phenomenon I witnessed 12 years ago while in Boston. A drunk bum fell and hit his head on a wall and was lying bleeding on the sidewalk. Business men in suits, on cell phones were stepping over him and looking back with contempt and disgust.

So after almost 30 hours of meditation I took my separation with the program as there are complications with three previously learned styles that created some risks I wasn't prepared to take and not told until I was already there. Reclaiming calm after was tough. I may yet go back and finish out, however at at time when the mosquitoes don't laugh at bug spray.
Deuces yall. See you after a long 10 day experience and a half.
In Az, it is not uncommon to see a "criminal" with his face all burnt up from the police holding it on a sidewalk that is hot enough to cook your eggs in the morning (during the summer).

Wait, isn't that the EXACT same hand position that was taught to us in driving school? So driving is reason enough to pull someone over for further investigation? I was to the understanding we had a 4th amendment to protect us from unlawful detainment, search and seizure of property and the need for "probable" cause. Thanks for removing more constitutional rights. This decision needs to be overruled, fight for your rights or watch them disappear.

These photo's aren't a damned thing compared to what they did to us at the WTO protests. A girl had an entire can unloaded into her face while she was handcuffed. When she had serious breathing issues upon arrival to jail (probably more realistically STILL had breathing issues), male officers cut her clothes off.
Welp, Elisabeth's phone got stollen this morning. Congrats to the cowardly black man picking on the small white woman to rob. Way to uphold the negative stereo types your hardworking brother's and sister's are trying to escape from.

I fought the law and I won... Woots... As of Wednesday all charges wee dropped for having a suspended license on private property while having an Asian lady rear end me. As it is not illegal to drive on a suspended license on private property, it was a wrongful arrest, one in which the officer even admitted knowing that I hadn't violated any laws. Her C.O. Made her bring me in anyways. Anyone know a good civil lawyer, it's my turn to play with the legal system.

Today I went to court for the second time to have the arresting officer fail to appear, only to have my court date pushed out further. Crock of shit considering the 12 bench warrants I've seen issued for missing one date at an obscurely early time.

The legal system in Dekalb is so fuckinng corrupt. Today marks the second time a continuance has been made for the officer's failure to appear because she is on "approved" leave. Interestingly this means she has been on vacation for over 4 months, and the case is reset for a couple weeks out. Yet any and every person on my side of the bench was flippantly condemned with a bench warrant. Our "justice" system hard at work.
Shame on you yet again #nathanDeal

What a total load of shit. It's currently a constitutionally given right to defend yourself, to the point of officer death, during a wrongful arrest. Resisting arrest is a load of shit if you are innocent till proven guilty.
Where cops have fancy cars, corruption abounds. LAPD must be dirty as fuck, my god.

Now this shit is past rediculous, you think the police state is bad now, keep sitting quiet it's sure to get far worse from here.
This post forgot a plucky boy and his tiger, or a fence painting sales kid. But all true :)
North Dakotans beware, oil companies are boning y'all like Freedom Industries nailed West Virginia. Bet no one goes to jail, again.

Get some Kentucky. Also, do the rest of the Southeast a favor and do research as to why CBD alone isn't as useful as with the THC. Once again, we are showing reticence to relinquish our slave labor force (best paying jobs in prison are ~$1.25, from what I saw). The only reason to dean the law like that is to continue the war on a harmless plant and imprisoning those found with it.
I like it
the rich get richer BECAUSE the less wealthy cannot help but pay them. Seems legit.
I honestly think it's only the under educated/lower iq portion of the followers that act like that.
Today, those in power often fail miserably.
It's cause you're simply aweful and useful for like 3% of people (not actual statistics)
Boy ain't that the truth.
Yeah, it's pretty much dead on win there, lol.
Incredible bullshit, I'm ashamed to live in Ga right now. #Shame on you again Governor #NathanDeal, how can you allow policy to persist that disallows the use of safe medication, while endorsing the use of pharmaceuticals (which kill more citizens each year than ALL other street drugs combined).
Folks help this poor child, wrongfully imprisoned, for simply standing as a video witness for the arrest procedure that was unfolding before him. In America we have a system of checks and balances, why should they not be applicable to those responsible for upholding the law of the land? If you have the money, please donate to help this kid see justice and to establish a legal president.
Getting closer to a high CBD, low to no THC strain being sold as a remedy here in GA.

So very true. Albert Hoffman (invented LSD) ate 2500 hits the fated day of the bicycle ride. He lived to 103 and continued to work in the field if chemistry and pharmacology for many years after that day with no ill side effects. It can't do anything but influence what is already there.
Ohh MYyyyy
So very true. Wake up Amerika, the time for revolution is now. Stand up and take action, your couch will be there when you return.

#Shame on #Georgia and #NathanDeal for even considering following #Arizona's bigoted legislature. How about we be on the side that doesn't have to hang it's head in shame this time, wasn't segregation and slavery enough? What part of the bible backs hating anyone or anything because they are different, I believe it speaks of "loving thy neighbor." How do you ignorant fools not get such clear language?
Contraception already has many previous cases that link it to the 9th commandment, abortion too. The crazy religious zealots that are trying to enforce their secular view onto the rest of the population just needs to give it a rest.

I would love my pardon for my "crime" of smoking what is now a legal medicine (that I have a prescription for in Cali) 2 days before I was "caught" driving under the influence of the substance (I was NOT, stoned at the time of arrest).
Nailed me right here, heyo
Holy shit this has escalated quickly.
Congrats New Hampshire

Fuck that bullshit

Fuck the bitch that mothered my child. Apparently her hours at work changed allowing me to talk to Rhian any night of the week... This change happened Thanksgiving and she tells me today as I question her about why I have been hearing so little from Rhian.
My thoughts and prayers go towards these brave people fighting for their freedom in the Ukraine.
Pity the oil companies won. Imagine being 100% self sustainable with our gas needs. Le sigh.

Funny, the two major diseases we've been "trying" to cure are helped by cannabis, which is made illegal by the holder of the patent for all medicines that stem from it... Smell like fish to anyone else?

3" and Atlanta is done for.
Fuck you Governor Deal, first you fail to see that the city is adequately prepared for a mere 3" of snow so we shut everything down like a bunch of pansies, but now you are already threatening to take people property to impound and make them pay costly fees, likely to generate the income necessary to not have the budgetary "setback," rather than taking from your own fat pocket... Again I say FUCK YOU!!! #Atlanta
It's a brand new day, who's ready for the first 100% to see the first car that runs entirely on hemp oil, have clothing, food, and building materials made 100% inside the country. Welcome to what could become self reliance.

Gotta love Atlanta... Shut down by 3" of snow, yet Home Depot helps rescue haha.
They really should have used a line from the actual episode...
"Sir... I'm gonna have to check your asshole..."
Of course it does... It means that your web of lies is evaporating as understanding of the chemicals banned without proper research (for reasons that are unprovable without research on an extensive level), is proving that the "reasoning" behind it was fear tactics, propaganda and misdirection through using popular media and the education system that we pay to have teach us lies you created "for our own good."
LMFAO what the shit?
Dude, you got a snowpocalypse on your bday, well played.

Already, because of the Affordable Care Act, more than 3 million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents' plans. (Applause.)

More than 9 million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage -- 9 million. (Applause.)" -Obama 2014 State of the Union

Without the reform, lives like Amanda's would be lost. You complaining about a system changing because it's uncomfortable on you is pathetic, you wouldn't complain if you, or someone you loved HAD to have it or die. Yes it's expensive, but see the expenditure as helping to save a life and quit being a selfish prick.
Oh I assure you all, there are lots.
It's pathetic, but where else can you live and manage to get multiple snow days for 3" snow ;)
Happy bday duder

Serve and what the fuck?!?
We the people need to stand up and take back our country. No longer shall corporations be considered "people." No longer will they be able to rape and pillage the land with minimal consequences.

Thank you Dekalb county for proving you are huge proponents of armed robbery. A traffic case that should have been on the dead docket got picked back up and I went to trial today. After issuing warrants for three people that failed to appear, it comes out that the arresting officer is on leave and not at the trial. Motion to dismiss got failed and the case got pushed back months. Why you ask? As the judge says "I believe in giving a person the extra chance." What about those three that ain't on team rob you at gunpoint with a badge you so flippantly condemned for the same awful crime of not showing up.
Lmfao
This is the same company that protected the manager that change my hours to kill insurance for myself and Rhian (then 1 and a half). Boycott the shit out of them.

If anyone in Ga knows any doctors... There is an important call. If yall didn't know, technically we still have medical cannabis legislation from the 80's, it needs a serious overhaul, but could be used as a strong base to build our medical regulations.

So, I think Gambler just lost my respect with his "outsource" bit. Aka, befriend a girl that other girls like (hard considering they tend to be catty, etc), have her talk you up, and virtually do all the work for you... Just make your outsource girl happy. Anyone else have thoughts on this one?

Get it girl, spread awareness of these terrible places.
Folks, check out and donate to this riveting documentary of gay teenagers, taken from their homes (parents pay for it) to be taken to the Dominican Republic for a vicious pray the gay away program. I'm sure some of you recognize similarities between how these kids ended up at the school they went to, and how many of us got to Northwest Academy. This documentary is particularly riveting to me, as I got sent to a "school for at risk youth" when I was a kid. The trauma I experienced isn't even close to what these poor kids went through/are going through. This is child abuse and I think all parents involved should be charged and convinced for the abuse they have caused.

looks like SOMEONE dropped a seed on the deck again...
Well the construction crew management hired to replace all the windows and apparently something with the balcony, jsut dropped a good portion of the balcony above me onto my bonsai garden. 1 pot destroyed, 1 tree severely damaged (of course my expensive tree), 2 plants with a bunch of substrate lost. Yup, job well done gentlemen. Not sure how construction folks have that moment of "Opps, didn't think it would fall if I pulled the screw out" *facepalm*

More of America should embrace eleutheromania (such an awesome word spell check doesn't know it) and stand up to say they disagree with the shit that has been happening in our country. ;-)
Operation Northwoods was a series of false flag proposals that originated within the United States government in 1962, but were rejected by the Kennedy administration.[2] The proposals called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), or other operatives, to commit perceived acts of terrorism in U.S. cities and elsewhere. These acts of terrorism were to be blamed on Cuba in order to create public support for a war against that nation, which had recently become communist under Fidel Castro.[3] One part of Operation Northwoods was to "develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington".

Operation Northwoods proposals included hijackings and bombings followed by the introduction of phony evidence that would implicate the Cuban government.

Source...
Wait what???? Osama worked with the Govt??? His brother is business partners with the Bush family too?? Now wait a min... Why isn't the entire family in prison for treason and war crimes? Hold the phone... Operation Northwoods was a CIA plan to attack American cities to stir up Cuban hatred so we'd go to war with them... Hrmm, sounds kinda familliar, looks kinda suspicious, dont ya think?
Shocker ain't it? I wonder what the number of human birth defects cause is and if we can press charges/what those charges would be?

Holy amazing, I wish police here would do much of the same.
“It is not our own citizens only who are to receive the bounty of our government. More than eight millions of the stock of this bank are held by foreigners… is there no danger to our liberty and independence in a bank that in its nature has so little to bind it to our country? … Controlling our currency, receiving our public moneys, and holding thousands of our citizens in dependence… would be more formidable and dangerous than a military power of the enemy.”

Andrew Jackson warning of the dangers of centralized banking 1832 (3 years before being the only president in US history to pay off the national debt).
“I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution – taking from the federal government their power of borrowing.”
-Thomas Jefferson 1798

Terri KingIt truly saddens me that the entire incident is now being widely called a conspiracy. The dead don't deserve this. Not everything that happens in the States is a government conspiracy. The armchair experts need to lay off the hallucinogenics.
Terri KingMass media doesn't override the common people who saw it, video taped it, or died after calling their families from the plane does it? They seem to coincide with the fact it was most definitely a plane. Planes were grounded, but the ones in the air were re-routed and that's likely what you saw. 12 yrs ago is a long time for someone who would have been what? 13/14 at the time? You sound like these "truth" websites are distorting your real memories. It's quite common after a traumatic event.
Terri KingI only saw what was televised moments after. Live feed didn't happen anywhere. The problem with theories is in the word itself--theory. The fact is that it happened, it was terrorism, and far too many people died. Far too many have died as a result of it as well. Every time I hear of someone calling any terrorist act a 'conspiracy' I get sick over the number of men and women who have died from the chain reaction of events this caused. Including the fact my husband ran the risk of being killed fighting terrorism so both our countries don't become overrun with them. You're a smart guy. Don't let yourself be sucked in by these people who post that crap to draw attention to themselves. They want to be the new Deep Throat. Look what that code name ended up meaning years later. ;)
Terri KingI meant on our networks we saw the recorded live cam, later, not at the precise time it was happening. There could very well have been detonations from the plane sending projectiles. The point is, I don't believe there is any conspiracy other than the terrorists themselves. True, but that's still what they're looking for. Notoriety. "The person who revealed all" regardless of what they have to misconstrue. It's just pathetic because they make it sound reasonable and lure people in.
Terri KingIt's entirely too huge of an incident for secrets to be coming out now.
Terri KingBecause of the demand for transparency. It's the catch 22 with military strategy. The public DEMANDS to know everything them blames the government when things happen. Siri's awesome that way, autocorrects evil twin sister. ;)
Terri King/\ see? Autocorrect decides then should be them
Terri KingI hate autocorrect 😤 now THERES a conspiracy!
Terri KingSeriously? You can't hide flight paths. And with all these people claiming contrails are 'chemtrails' since forever, it's very easy for someone looking for it to find it. Who knows who else was involved? But not your former president. That goes beyond logical thought my dear. He was criticized then for not immediately launching a counter strike too. Thank god he didn't.
Terri KingThere may well have been one person who leaked it. But one person does not mean the entire government is at fault. Therein lies the problem with people getting their butts in a knot over monitoring. That's how we recently preempted a terrorist attack here recently. As far as the government monitoring my life? I WISH I had a life interesting enough to monitor! I lack a sense of superego so I sincerely don't care if they do. There is so much more to it than a catch all blame laid at the feet of one group of people.
Terri KingYes, I said recently twice...it's been a long shift here. Lol
Jessica Eierman Wenknow I have spent the last hr looking at 911 conspiracy videos. This kinda shit just sucks me right in, lol.

#truth. The shit "required" to learn in "history" class is an amended history that isn't actually fact, in many cases. The truth of our country is far more grim. Out humble start makes even Hitler look like a nice guy. You can trust the government, just ask the Native Americans (who we are screwing yet again, currently).

I MAY have to involve this one :p
Call #6... Fuck you very much rep........
My letter to Max Baucus...

Rep Max Baucus,

Please immediately preform a late term abortion on yourself by chewing on a bullet, drinking the shit under your sink, or stuffing a live grenade up your ass (provided you have room with your head so firmly up your ass). You and the rest of congress, need to be sterilized so you cannot reproduce and create more greedy pricks such as yourself. With the bullshit you are pulling, for the second time, you are making the ameriken populace a joke to the rest of the world. Stop thinking you are somthing special since you got to "congress," to myself, and the rest of the world, you are nothing more than a money grubbing, soulless, moron, bent on making your own wallet fat, while fucking the people that elected you. Remember we are the people that pay your check, which in any other profession makes us your boss. Stop serving your own interests and help us out.

Sincerely,
FUCK YOU YOU GREEDY FUCK
here we go for call # 5 :P
Rep Cunthia Lummons.
here's to abusing representatives of congress while drunk :-D
here comes call #3...
First up... a representative from Texas... Rep Fuckwad mcJizzface (don't remember his name, pretty sure i actually called him the above)
lol, thanks Ashton for sharing this site :-D

Very true, our government is a bunch of drama queens that just care about one thing, how fat their wallet is. Fuck the government, they been doing it to you for years without a reach around.
Don't be afraid of a little tear gas if police get out of control, also do t believe the media that protestors start anything. Care to see a reference do that two movies to watch "Battle in Seattle," and "The Miami Model." Warning, you WILL see horrible acts of police brutality on peaceful protesters, many cases just trying to move from harms way. You will also note the "officers" perpetrating said violence have no identification as such, all black uniform, no badge(not legal). We are given rights by birth, but have to be aware of them and fight to keep them. Don't sit idle while terrible things go on. We the people outnumber the greedy people putting us down, stand up and say you've had enough. :)
Sadly, I have work. Congrats though dude, way to get-r-done.

I had to smack the hood of a car a couple weeks ago to stop some daft driver from hitting another guard cause she didn't understand what I said and did FOUR times. It's crazy to say the least...

I know more than a few this applies to, although just can't remember any names.
Finally the right fight has been picked. News flash folks, money printed at the Federal Reserve is SOLD to the government in imaginary bond amounts, for money that does not exist. That means for every dollar on the market (a majority of which isn't even physical, only a number online) the is debt. The cycle cannot end, ad infinitum. Our central bank is NOT government owned, mostly foreign banking guru's on the board. Do you not see a serious logic flaw with this, can it EVER end well for a majority of the people? How did a system like this even get out into place?
Have fun to all my folks at the screening, two movies I've worked on being shown tonight. Get some Trent and Taylor Giddens.

Albert Hoffman lived to be 102 and consumed ~2000 hits of LSD as the lab could not believe it was active in such a small dose. As he continued to work in the complicated field of chemistry, I presume the lasting effects were null and void. I think many people have seen through the cannabis propaganda, maybe it's time to evaluate some other things too. Many of the wonderful things we enjoy today came as an inspiration of a psychedelic drug. There is vast therapeutic uses, please refer to maps.org for information on current research studies.
I totally would be too, badass.

Not sure what I think of this... Kinda a disturbing way to voice outrage at Fl having a bunch of jackasses living there.
You know those plans you always have for dressing in zombie makeup and freaking people out?

Yup... I've been studying SUUUPER hard... Now at episode 7, season 8... Weeds. Pity my exam isn't on the cannabis biz... Also... Holy awesome pharmacy company lol.
I want to see religion fade away so the people of the world stop senselessly stop killing each other because they follow a different imaginary man in the sky.
I want to see the greedy fucks in Wall Street that collapsed the global economy actually see jail time for their crimes.
But most importantly, I want to see the world come together and figure out how we are going to survive our destructive nature so our kids have a planet to inherit.

Just wanted to add a few more in :)
Ahh shit... Need to study and just found a season of Weeds I haven't sen on Netflix...
What the duece is wrong with the radio these days. Everlast's song "what it's like" came on the air and when they got to "max lost his head, pulled out his colt 45, talked some shit and wound up dead," they censored the colt 45 part. Freedom of speech my ass.
An let only criminals and law enforcement have guns? Hell freaking no. I wanna KNOW that if someone breaks into my house I will be able to defend it rather than bringing a water pistol out an hoping for the best.
Oh shit... Who knew Godzilla was a prophetic movie?
Lol love this one
Story of my life.
Yes, I'd much rather be in the back of the limo with her.
What assholes, it takes less than an hour to develop serious dehydration in the desert. Bet they a shooting to sell loads of water etc... I'd say just don't give them money, or demand it back. A hit to the wallet always takes the greed outta a douche bags eyes.
Cool beans
Dear Georgia State... I am taking my first rain day from class mostly because I do NOT need the librarian to teach me how to research for a project EVERY semester of the school year, let alone TWICE this semester (once in each class). Plus, google is 100000000x better than the crappy server y'all have... K thanks :)
Peter clearly doesn't know that it's freaking cold and minus oxygen in space, but still a good message.
They might not, but as the master of your universe, you can choose not to let them in. (Easier said than done)
Do not stand at my grave and weep;
I am not there. I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow.
I am the diamond glints on snow.
I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
I am the gentle autumn rain.
When you awaken in the morning's hush
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft stars that shine at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry;
I am not there. I did not die.
I love that the game "Last of US" went with a possible method of zombies happening.... Slight mutation and it's off ants and too bigger prey.
Frankly, I think the US starting an illegal war in Iraq to turn it into the top country for oil production out us further ahead. Syria can't stand up to one nation, let alone many of them. Honestly, I think the reason behind our government bombing the Boston marathon was to prepare for martial law, should there be an invasion. (Yes it was the government, if you have ANY doubt, look at the pics of the murdered children from the security cameras around the area. Neither are carrying a black backpack, let alone one that has a tag on the top of it, only the uniformed man with the seal team 3 logo on his hat was.)
Seriously folks, the rainforest in South America creates most of the oxygen o. The planet, yet we are busy destroying what literally gives us life... I call that insanity.
Beyond cool
It's always the small print that ruins the fun...
Next time you meet a homophobe explain to them that they themselves are 50% fruit and should really stop hating themselves so much ;)
Just plain aww
Mine told me this too. Probably a good thing she was way wrong... I was pure evil
Lol
I tend to go for tickle death over broken nose, but still funny.
You can trust the government, just ask a Native American.
Humans are more like a parasite than anything else IMO. We have entered a "host" (earth) and are now so busy destroying it, we may see what happens when we go too far.
With most religions preaching the same core morals, we're kinda all the same religion.
What a bitch
Holy amazing artwork Batman
Folks beware of ticks, we have a rampant season upon us.
Those awkward moments..
Wait a min... Didn't Hitler do something like this once before? Must be going back to our humble beginnins, problem is, not just one race affected this round, it's a class war. Apparently the government is now full on waging war on the people who pay their salary.

What makes this possible is that HIV is just a mutated bubonic plague virus, debatably man made and intentionally released. See video for more on that.

So with all the damned rain scheduled for this weekend, skydiving is likely no go, and camping will be a very wet adventure. Next weekend looks like rain again, we'll have to reschedule or something. :(

Our history is nothing to be proud of, we started with a. Genocide worse than hitler, progressed into the awful treatment of another race of people, and have almost single handed lay destroyed the environment with our sheer greed. Why again should I be proud to be an American?
A big thank you to Chase bank for placing a week and a half hold on a cashiers check (same a cash) preventing me from being able to pay my tuition for this semester. Looks like I have the summer off due to bank negligence.
Say congratulations to two expecting parent zombies by voting for their photo. Help give them a gift for the baby to be.
bam, she came close, but didn't catch up last night... good job folks.. early am vote and bump here we go :-D
Pimping paintings...
So much for lighting my BBQ tonight... :P
The US "justice" system is a freaking joke. The violent offender is back out in no time, while the non-violent computer geek rots in jail. For all you "be patriotic" types... This is why I despise what is going on in this country, let alone our sordid past that makes Hitler look nice.
Early morning vote and shout out in.... #2 is falling behind, but definately not out... Thanks to all of you that are voting daily and sharing out to your friends.
Happy b-day good sir, hope it's a great one.
Happy bday hommie
Ok, for realisies this time... I'm going to bed... FB stop tempting me with interesting tidbits :p
Seriously, y'all that blame Obama are just plain dumb. Sure he has negative aspects, however he actually gives a damn enough about those of us without millions in the bank to stand up to congress and tell them NO, you will not remove funding from federal aid programs to give further tax breaks to your rich friends.

I learned something ridiculous today... Did you know that our tax dollars fund financial aid for children of Government workers (under 24) who make twice as much per year as parents that disallows regular folk from getting financial aid, until 24? So basically, these people make enough to put 4 kids through college, and STILL live comfortably, yet don't have to pay for their college.. How bs is that?
This sounds familiar. Where have I heard about a similar situation?
This zombie is taking the night off... Hope y'all have a lovely Friday night... Catch y'all on the flip side :)
This place looks freaking awesome. Also... a little protip... check out the awesome contest they have going ;-)
Interesting exposé on racial profiling. If you don't believe that exists still in this country.... Think again..

Happy b-day brother.. Hope it's a great one.
With the estimated costs of the drug war, the price per head in prison per year and the power we are willingly putting in the hands of the "terrorists" we fight, tis a good point. The gov could then be making the money our "enemies" are getting by importing these substances, which could be dispersed to programs that desperately need it, such as school, federal aid programs and repairs that get overlooked. Thousands each year would not looses their lives as medical staff could be called in cases of OD, plus the taxes gained from the sales.... Well who knows what billions extra/year could accomplish.
Such a bitch
Grumpy cat...

Sweet, anyone else wanna join me for some possession in the park?

So I just passed what might be the nicest police officer I have ever seen. He had a black man outside of his vehicle which normally means this man is going to jail in Georgia, Instead this cop was bent over and put a new tire on this guys vehicle. This right here is the meaning of serve and protect And that Officer deserves a medal for not being one of the racist police officers here in GA.
If y'all haven't logged into MySpace and set up your acting profile, you are missing out on being able to use your myspace link as a website. The new layout makes it really conducive and a simple, clean easy layout. In the end even that will make you more professional, if you haven't done the Wordpress dealio yet. Frankly, that just seems way more trouble than it's worth in comparison. Check it out www.new.myspace.com.

Just walk away from the person that expects you to, they aren't worth your time.
Anyone else think this is a better adaption than the original?
Hehe
Folks, if you haven't already, you should resize all the head shots you use to ~500 kb, rather than 5 Mb+. This will only make it easier for you to get cast, as you are making it easier on the person doing the casting (They don't have to rezise your image so they can view it on their screen). I have heard more than a few casting folks complaining about all the large images they receive and have to resize themselves.
If y'all haven't already, try to resize all headshots used to fit on a computer screen. You want somewhere around 500kb, not 5Mb. Please if you are referring people to David, make sure they too are aware of this, it makes it much easier for the person casting, which makes you more likely to book. I don't know if any here are among those that did not with David, just figured I'd pass the word through here, as well.
This is why there is no suffering for me...

Seriously folks, not sketchy that neither of the kids "responsible" for the Boston bombing were carrying a black backpack, were murked before they could be questioned, and now the people responsible are gone and cannot be questioned? Too many coincidences for this guy to believe...
Greetings TWD enthusiasts. Now don't run for your crossbow just yet, this zombie has given up eating the legs of old farmers. If you are interested in having an autographed photo, let me know. Here are the prints I can sell.
If pesticides in weed are bad, I imagine the plethora of crap they put on a majority of our "FDA approved" food is just as bad, if not worse.

My loving dad about the work I did today.

Folks, I have a us Netflix movie that you must see. It's called "the Wave." A really amazing German movie, don't miss it.
I sure do. If it slows and even reverses cancer cell growth, with 0 chance of killing the user, it's better than ANY pharmaceutical on the market. FYI, pharmacies kill more people each year than ALL street drugs combined, yet we still think the FDA has our best interests at heart?
That's how I plan to go out, fighting till my last breath... Valhalla here I come

"By the way, we will be by tomorrow to drop you off at the nearest appropriate underpass full of similar souls. That's the closest thing us humans have to Animal Control. Don't worry, there will be others there that you can quickly identify with. They have all disappointed their parents, as well as everyone else. "

Poor Mufasa....
I wanna know how some people can just be so senselessly mean to someone, ruining a friendship and causing their ex "friend" to doubt themselves and think they are a "terrible person" just cause they were going to be late to a hang out. Go put a tampon in and take a midol and stop harassing one of the nicest people I know.
Ok, I'm finally back off to bed... Damn kitten better not sucker pounce me again or he's not gonna have a warm comfy cuddle buddy again for a while.
Or your haircut, clothes, style, etc. most of these guys are not your friend, they are literally men with guns out to get you... Feel safer?
Too true not to spread
Damn you Thor... 3 am, while I'm sleeping, I promise no matter how cute you are, I do NOT want to play. K thanks... Bastard.
ladies and gentlemen, I have good news for many of us.... I was approached by a production coming to Atlanta, end of october, to be a zombie. They are about 35 zombies short of where they want to be..... I'm sure you all can see where I am going here. They need some of us skinny types, however I'm betting they will take some of our thicker brothers and sisters..... The good news does not end here, however... If I am understanding properly, SAG will also be required. Yup... I love Twitter. who's interested?
Such truth from such a fuzzy puppy

This poor squirrel has now hung out on my profile a couple times. Lol
Well I sure saw Nashville last night, what an awesome trip.
Happy b-day lady face. Hope it's been freaking amazing.
~45 on my room, heading to what's professed to be the best burger in town...
Just hit the outskirts of Nashville... Only an hour ahead of schedule... Yup... That just happened
I love that moment you blow past the cop, well above the speed limit, but he's too busy with a doughnut to notice.
Hello tires, meet road, y'all gonna be good friends today. Out the door, Nashville bound.
Boy ain't that the truth.
Gents, I had a stroke of inspiration, yesterday. I am heading up to Nashville for a comic convention, but I wanna find some good pints, music and ladies. The platform I choose to scout for that was Ok Cupid, did a location search and tossed together one message that got sent to multiple ladies. I picked 5 of the hottest girls I saw listed in the area and fired. Of course 4/5 were happy to reply with their suggestions, which I read as where I am likely to run into these ladies. Thought I would share this fun little idea with the class.
Nashville bound in the morning. Woot!
Folks, please vote again for the lovely diner thwt hosted us while shooting the shorty "beyond the Fire."
Love it
Wow, that's familiar.
lol
there is a lot of truth in this one.

Dirty Wars - Official Trailer (HD) Documentary, Thriller

Check this documentary out, this is likely why we are practicing martial law by bombing our own city.
Why yes, just yesterday they got stuck in the windowsill.
Proof America is just as evil as Nazi Germany, and then some. Just ask our native friends if you should trust the government.
To those that hang out with my ex... I do NOT want to hear stories of her hooking up. Be a friend and do not pass her escapades on.
Goodie, we may just be able to get the rich, greedy assholes that have ravaged this planet, to another habitable planet, before this one is fully destroyed.
Happy birthday Vicky, hope it's freaking fantastic :-D
Ain't tha the truth.
Lol

Suzi MadronNice!! I've got an amethyst geode I've had my eye on for a while, but have held off getting it. You've got a gorgeous one there!
Angela FordVery beautiful:-)
Must go here!!!
Totally badass space saving design...
I see it like this.... Washington will see endless revenue and probably have to stop reliance on e federal government. What the extra tax pays for is state self reliance. Fixed roads, better parks, security, and a completely repaired local economy. While the extra cost sucks, I think what it gains, locally, SHOULD be worth it in the end. Any debate on that?
Yay, power's back
I am camping out in my house, while I sent the payment to the power company a week it so ago, the power had been cut due to non-payment. Bastards.
Giggity.
Damn they got some gold coming out today :-D
OMG I want this tree in my collection

Here's a little summer preparation for any of you camping types out there.

UMMMMM YES PLEASE
Smexy
Michael Lapihuska shared a photo to your timeline.
Michael Lapihuska is facing a sentence that could be as severe as 10 years in prison, not for rape, burglary or assault, but for the possession of a single joint’s worth of marijuana.

Michael suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and has used cannabis for many years to combat the symptoms of his illness. After suffering arrests for possession, he moved to California.

There a doctor recommended he take marijuana for his disorder, and he became a legal patient in the state’s medical marijuana program.


This has to make any rational person ask at least some of the following questions:
First, why are we still arresting people for possessing a substance that has been found to be less harmful than alcohol, tobacco or acetaminophen?

Second, since Michael is a legal patient in California’s medical marijuana program, why would Alabama wish to intercede in an agreement between the state of California, a doctor and a patient?

Third, even if it is against the law, what is the point of imposing such an exaggerated sentence upon the perpetrator of a victimless crime?

Fourth, do you want to pay your taxes so that the state of Alabama can house a prisoner for the possession of one joint?

Fifth, why would anyone want to put a patient, not a criminal, in jail for taking his medicine?

I could ask questions like this all day long, and the one thing that they have in common is their indication of the senselessness of the situation.

During the escalation of the war on drugs in the 1990s, the United States Justice Department promoted its actions as an effort to take down the drug lords. However, 80 percent of the increased arrests were for marijuana possession.
If you are convicted of possession of marijuana, your chances of serving prison time are four percent greater than those of someone convicted of trafficking marijuana – 31 percent of marijuana users are sentenced to jail or prison time; traffickers, 27 percent.

This crazy war is not living up to the billing. We have spent millions upon millions of dollars in South America eradicating coca, but there is more cocaine in America than ever.

We eradicate marijuana grown in the U.S., which just means more marijuana coming from Mexico and more money going into the hands of Mexican drug cartels.

Even if marijuana was every bit the dangerous substance they would have you believe, it still could not do 10 percent of the damage that prohibition has done to America.

Lapihuska already suffers from PTSD, and due to the possession of one joint, this man has been placed under extreme mental stress wondering if he is going to be spending the next 10 years of his life in prison.

It is amazing that our government is willing to trample the constitutional rights of its citizens and inflict such harm on society in order to protect the fiscal interests of the oil, pharmaceutical, chemical and timber companies.

It seems that our politicians are more concerned with campaign contributions and maintaining the status quo than they are to justice or the fair treatment of Americans.

Michael Lapihuska is not a criminal. He is a 37-year-old man with a likable personality who is quite literally willing to give you the shirt off his back. This is not prosecution, it is persecution, and there comes a time when people of good conscience cannot sit idly by and allow their government to persecute their fellow citizens.

Happy birthday brother, I hope all is well with you and you have a fantastic 30th.
What an amazing piece.

John Michael Lapidesnever forget the kitchen when playing, a few dried bread crumbs integrated into latex has often increased the vomit factor. keep up the gross work.
Twice we have been attacked while our military was doing a training exercise of the exact same nature, preventing the attack from being stopped. You can trust the government, just ask the Native Americans.
Heyo, that's a fun game
I'm just gonna leave this here...

Brotip #696969 How to really tell her you care.
Food for thought. If we agree that the planet is a living thing, then we should possibly consider that it too bleeds... Considering that, what would you guess the black stuff from the ground is?
What do you think William? Scary enough?
Brilliant way to inspire people giving a damn about their local community. Bet it cuts down on crime in the area, too.

For anyone that has seen the Silent Studios "Team Zombie US" poster. I separated ways with them over a month ago, got threats of violence from the "team leader" and in no way shape or form do they have permission to use my image. Anyone know a good lawyer?

Such a great status, had to share.
Folks, Monday is the day to get autographed photos in the mail. I have yet to hear from any other walkers who want to throw their photo in the mail, as well. I have some time today to haul around and pick up a few. Anyone want to donate with me?
If any zombie friends would like to get one of their 8x10's in to the Rootin for Regen silent auction (I know many are at DOTD) I have tomorrow to pick them up, and can ship them with mine, Monday. Just let me know if you would like toss in.

Interesting note. Through twitter, I have befriended many folk over in the UK and London. I asked about Silent Studios and the funny thing is, no one has heard of them. The website is up on free hosting, with not much more than photos. The Colchester Castle convention they were talking about, does not exist in google, ours OR the EU one. The company, supposed to be a "huge production company" over there, does not exist off the free website. There is nothing legit that I have been told, heard, or seen that has been found about them. Thought yall should know. :-/
Kuja DuncanI wanna be there!!
Brandon WeeksDo y'all get royalties for this stuff?
Please those that see this, repost in any social media fashion you can. At the very least, share the link to their main page. If that is all you can do to help this poor child back to health, then you are doing your part.

Valid points all, here's my ace in the sleeve. If anyone can find a valid argument to prove that we, as a species, are not overpopulated with too many mouths to feed, then perhaps gay marriage can wait for a bit. However, if the case may be, where thousands of people, in EVERY country are starving, there is a simple solution that allows people to volunteer to not be a problem, gay marriage. Have fun coming up with a valid counter argument. :-)

I vote we kidnap her and take her to Vegas, any financiers?
Happy birthday dude, go have a blast and do something stupid enough to get a scar with an awesome story you can't remember, but are sure was epic.
lol made me think of you ;)
Wise words. I suppose that if you follow the money the Bush and Bin Laden families stand the most to gain. As America rushes head first into a war, these two families own a majority of the company producing the weapons... I think that means the terrorists live in Tx.
I think women should push for the freedom to go topless, should they choose. Why cause fuck the man.

If any of our lovely lady zombies are interested, there is a radio show that has a woman in horror show, this Friday. If you are interested in participation you should contact Nicole to see if she has any more open spots. This is the same radio show that just hosted Dave Vescio, talking about his past and his role in the movie Hick (the creepy pool shark that gets his ass kicked). Having listened to an interview prior to sending people in, the hosts of the show do an amazing job of listening to their guest's replies, and asking questions that make sense to ask, no "tactical bacon" here.

Gaelic Storm in Wednesday, same place. You gonna go?
Holy amazing jellyfish.
Lovely.
Haha

A villain to keep you eyes on. Check out his demo reel and tell me the bottle cap character doesn't make your skin crawl. Creepy stuff. He can be seen, taking a hell of a beating, in the movie Hick. Check him out.
Lets play a rousing game of name that movie from the quote...

"The fugitive is a male negro, unarmed, but possibly angry."

A hint will be dropped after a few failed guesses... Ready GO!
Lovely.
Wise words to remember for you ladies.
Things to do on the slow nights at work... play with Instagram.
Yeah, make it happen lady.
Boy ain't that the truth.
Parents the people that you are supposed to be able to rely on the most... Sad to know that I can rely on their "support" about as much as walking really thin ice. Sure it may support you for a little bit, but it'll fail you in the end.
Wooot, this looks awesome.
Go gabby
Good morning Facebook.
Love the background. I seem to recognize that ugly mug from somewhere...
If you want the truth, talk to me. Want a fancy cloud of smoke, it's already in your in box.
Yup, left the Silent Studios group and am now getting threats from Mike Mundy, good times.
Happy b-day lady. Sorry I missed you when I was out your way, had to haul my ass back to the other side.
Photo's from Atlanta South Comic Convention have been sorted and put up on my fan page. Be sure to check them out.
Charlie Leach... you's be a rockstar on Ebay...

Wait, you aren't in Charleston any more?!?!?!
Inspiring words for your hump day.
Anyone else ready to go camping?
It's official.... Ollie likes beer.
I am truly honored by a fan from Atlanta Comic Convention, to see my photo attempting to sell at such a high price is freaking crazy. Thanks Michael Jaegers for telling me I was up there. Had to sort through ~600 posts from the silent film actor of the same name (William S Hart), complete with his own Hollywood star.

Everly GailScore big (: I win (:
Everly GailLove that ^^
Ashleigh Jo SmoreI get the feeling that I've been tagged in a rather private conversation....
Everly Gail....my bad /: lol
Ashleigh Jo SmoreNo, no, carry on. Pretend I'm not even here... ;) *sits back with some popcorn*
Wow, again Jackie Chin strikes. Contacts me, asking for help, when i have a few questions, refuses to answer. comes back hours later, while i'm busy, call me and leaves her number, tell her I need a few to finish up the meeting I was in, and call her 5 min later. Which she again ignores. So this is the rest of the interaction. Chick is clearly unhinged...


Well, guess you really didn't want my help. Later

7:56pm
Jackie Chin

im sorrrrrrrrrrrrry my network guy is on the cell with me right now ;-(

7:58pm

Yeah, already tried twice and nothing for my effort.

7:59pm
Jackie Chin

i have people pulling me all over the place. I have been nothing but kind to you if you are unhappy with me

7:59pm

That's incredibly rude.

7:59pm
Jackie Chin

then perhaps you should not speak to me any more

i was on the CELL eith my network guys

7:59pm

What? You contacted me for help?

7:59pm
Jackie Chin

good bye

8:01pm

Wow, I never said any of that. Sorry you are so stressed out, but I haven't done anything but try to help you. Don't take your stuff out on me... Super unprofessional.

The Walking Dead PC game has pretty good reviews, dunno if you're played it or are even aware of it. Runs on Macs, and it's 50% off for the next 13 or so hours.
Yay, something to take up time till TWD is back
I think I'm going to take it as a good sign we're 3 days into 2013 and its already my best year yet. Lets keep the momentum up. :-)

An atheist was walking through the woods.

'What majestic trees!'
'What powerful rivers!'
'What beautiful animals!'
He said to himself.

As he was walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him.

He turned to look. He saw a 7-foot grizzly bear charge towards him.

He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder & saw that the bear was closing in on him.

He looked over his shoulder again, & the bear was even closer.

He tripped & fell on the ground.

He rolled over to pick himself up but saw that the bear was right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw & raising his right paw to strike him.

At that instant moment, the Atheist cried out:
'Oh my God!'

The bear froze.
The forest was silent.

As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky.

'You deny my existence for all these years, teach others I don't exist and even credit creation to cosmic accident.'
'Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament?'

'Am I to count you as a believer?'

The atheist looked directly into the light, and said: 'It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask you to treat me as a Christian now, but perhaps you could make the BEAR a Christian?'

'Very well', said the voice.

The light went out. The sounds of the forest resumed. And the bear dropped his right paw, brought both paws together, bowed his head & spoke:

'Lord bless this food, which I am about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen.'
Shocker huh?
Interesting rand fact of the day.
Bad news hommie.... We lost a driver at work last night... My boss cannot give me the night off. Out at ~11, so will call you round then and see where yall at.
Happy bday G.
Good morning Facebook people.
Yay, I FINALLY have my truck back, it only took 3 weeks to get it all fixed up. Thank you Kemper insurance for being quick with the check.
Kate DempseyAwwww, that's your daughter? Cutie baby!
Wow, what an awesome Christmas. Got to talk to my monkey three days in a row. Folks, this hasn't happened since my kiddo left... I think, like the grinch, someone's heart grew a few sizes this year.
Merry Xmas to all my undead family. Hope y'all have had an awesome day.
Order Chinese from Chin Chin 2 and you may get a surprise delivery from me :-).
This is wrong on so many levels.

Who's up for some a fun game of "mess with the West Borough Babtist folk?" Thanks anonymous for getting this fresh round of fun set up. Please do share your fun and creative ways to make those sorry dbags, listed in the comments, as miserable as they choose to make everyone around them. If you have a problem with this approach, refer to the first section of the comments BEFORE chiming in. I believe the reasoning listed there is beyond valid. GAME ON!!!

Hey now, if he eats responsibly, it's all good. He has Rudolph for a DD, got all his bases covered.
Happy b-day lady, hope it's a great one.
Happy b-day bro. Hope it's been a freaking blast.
What??
Totally agree dude, that is awesome.
I really hope that wasn't the school the kids my ex-wife nanny's for goes to. It is in her area and I cannot reach her. :-/
Is there an art and such and such party this New Years?
Funny to imagine 10 years ago I was homeless and hitch hiking back up to Boston to see a wonderful lady and a good friend. I never thought I would be where I am today. Thank you to all the friends that have helped me along the way. Y'all are family and I love you dearly.

Kate DempseyNO! I am a little slow. That's my story and I'm sticking to it >:I
SO due to my time at conventions, I have acquired a Square card reader, so I can take CC payments. This will come in handy at the Fundrager, if people come to the door sans cash. They take I think 2.75% sadly, but better than having to turn people away.
I can't tag you in those pics, they are up on my profile tag yourself if ya like :-D.
Happy Caroline, It's been for freaking ever since we caught up. Drop me a line sometime, it'd be cool to see what you up to in life these days.
Allo poppet, FB tells me it be yo b-day. Hope it's the shit G. Get yo hustle on!
Kev do you mind if we just make a note here with dude's info. He seems to be the guy to talk to and we get asked often enough that we might as well just have access to the info, always. That way we can almost step up as the group with the after plan, for those zombies that want to continue on.
Oh snap.
Happy b-day crazy lady
Love it Kevin, lets organize
Fun times at Atlanta Comic Con.
	
Jamie HueneckeA fan?
The question is are we going 3d or no?
Apparently Manson still has his moments. Isn't dude like 40-50 now, or does he even age with his pact with the devil and all?
Ummm.... GIGGITY
Wise words my bodacious friend. Would they even have a crime rate if they didn't go after non-violent offenders?
Wise words Sir Troll... The thing about wise words is, they must be passed on. Arigato Goziamasu

What Walking Dead character would you most like to see kill the Jar Jar walker??

Thank you Netflix for adding a lot of foreign films to your selection. Apparently Indian movies (more likely than Pakistani I think) are amazing, and strange. Action films have full on song sequences, as do comedies. I totally couldn't be an Indian actor, I just can't sing.
is linking REALLY the only way gifs can be put on FB? What reason would Zuckerburg have for leaving that code out? Are gifs really that large?
So it became clear to me yesterday that I need to instate a rule on my FB. I am all for intellectual debate, but the minute I see ANY name calling, instead of reasoning with the jackass responsible an immediate block will ensue. So let's all just be big boys and girls and leave 2nd grade where it belongs. For most, if not all on my page, that means the past. :-D
What sort of trouble to get into today???
ahhh crap, i gotta work tomorrow, I think. Lemmie see if i can get outta it :-P. After the all or nothing gambit on my japanese final, B< I pass the class, anything less and I D fail (pass but doesn't count as a pass to the next level). Yay stupid technicalities

Facebook, thank you for providing hours of entertainment today, what a great way to unwind from the stress of finals.
Happy bday, hope it is filled with all the beauty and love you bring into other's lives. Still bummed I missed you, when I came to town last. You have been a wonderful friend, hope to be able to catch up next time.
Sara Mcintyre-BergoldI see you theived it lol
Anthony RinaldoI hear if you are bitten by one of these Walking Grateful Dead zombies its a horrible death,1st you start hallucinating like you're on acid,next you stop bathing and shaving and try to cover the smell of your rotting ass wt patchouli oil.You then wandering around the country begging for a miracle, listening to awful music.But dont fear these zombies...they only feast on granola ;-)
On a completely unrelated note... Who's in for a road trip this summer? I miss the west coast and would love to have a lovely vacation :-D.
Woot!! Now the ball is in the Federal court, let's see if we can get full legalization.
Japanese final completed, it went WAY better than I thought it would, however if I failed one section that I had issues with, I failed the other too, lol. Go go all or nothing.
For those is school, always pickup the smart girl in your class. Sure she may not be the best looking girl in class, but she can be of great help come finals. Take one for the team Nd nail the smart chick, that way you have the answers to the test ;-).
Giggity.
Anyone wanna go mess with some church type people this Sunday? I'm thinking that walking in the door, screaming in pain and then busting into a demonic voice and speak in tongues, lol.
I know stop lights are a pain to wait through Me Atlanta PD officer, but it is pathetically lazy to not even have the patience to spend the 2seconds to turn on those fancy blue lights you abuse. It is criminal that less than a week after getting a ticket for "not coming to a full stop" (2sec not 3) I witness one of Atlanta's finest ignore the same law. That asshole should have to pay a fine like the rest of us. You police us, but who the fuck watches you?

Just wish this shitty day would end.
Shame on you Montana, I hope each and every officer that refused to respect the families wishes get fired and put on jail for home invasion, provided they didn't have a warrant, then a judge needs to go down too.

Huh, used for renewable construction materials too... What is hemp NOT good for and why isn't this shit 2000000% legal and used? Stupid people in power have the chance to save the economy, switch away from unsustainable building practices, stem deforestation and we have resistance? wtf?

Andrei NesbitHans Eckerle
Paul Yumangwow yummy.....
Charlotte Roxanne Roxanneok, now i need your autograph.
Liz MytingerThank you for getting this for me you're awesome!
If you saw yourself in last nights show and would like a screen cap, let me know. I did the iTunes season pass, again and with careful timing I can screenshot it from my iPad.
If you are coming to diesel filling station, I highly suggest coming down already.
Are you already down at diesel?
So, I know you all are going to forget and stuff, so here's a reminder.

So... Ummm... I wanna beat it.... that sounds freaking awesome.
Uh oh..... Some one hit the top of the hill.... Sorry I didn't get your walker to you, on time. I hope you still have enough mobility to have fun on you b-day.
Ya know, I think there's something exciting that's going on tonight, I just can't remember what it is. Can someone remind me of why 9pm is so special tonight?
So Ollie came out today, which was no surprise, we all knew that little pup was a queen.
あなたが私のメッセージを解読おめでとうございます、あなたがあなたの手にあまりにも多くの時間を持っています。
Sara Coreyaw she looks like you!!
Charles FlowersLucky Man! She's cute as a button
Sarah Stonershes adorable beautiful little lady :)
Esmee BancroftToo fucking cute!!!!
For a real alcohol themed day, I have totally been there, lol.
:-D
Awwwwwww yeah :-D
To all my Atl based zombies... Come out to diesel filling station Sunday for TWD viewing party, lets rage it out :-)
Dude, where the hell are you? Been trying to reach you for a while, hope all is well, call a Hommie.
Well, I passed the Japanese midterm... Barely. Having to think in another language is hard enough, imposing a 5-8 minute time restraint on all sections doesn't leave time to think. Damn you ADD!
Interesting concept, I don't know about anyone else, but I'm curious to see if it will work to change anything. The idea is solid, however that always discounts the greed of those in power.
Talk about a T-bag, lol.
who knew?
Or as Robin Williams claims, "proof that god smokes marijuana"
T-minus 6.5 hours till my Japanese midterm, feeling pretty solid on it.
B+ on philo midterm, woot woot.
Ahh the TRUE story of human development. You see at the end there, we become a parasite, killing out host body.
But Jesus was the Original zombie, come on Mr Bunny, get your head together.
Dirty, lying, greedy airline bastards.
HAHAHA, such a beautiful little girl.
Boy aint that the truth.
If you have the time ;-)
This actually seems like GOOD news... If Romney looses Fox, then he looses the empty heads of Americans everywhere.
Kai RobbinsWhy am I the only guy that's tacked onto this photo? :P
Kai RobbinsExcuses...
Lori RistHow did he (she) know?
Shellie DayI saw this and wanted it for my page.. I love it. So me!
Thanks Sara Corey, this is a beautiful message.
So it turns out Ollie is a dog with a political mind. The latest Rolling stone contains a 10 page hate spread on Romney, with a cartoon picture of him, on the front. Ollie decided the cartoon picture was a good place to put a giant turd. Apparently, Romney lost the dog vote, along with women and minorities. Wonder how he will cope with that strong loss on his campaign trail?
I have my desktop up and running for the first time in almost a year. Got my recipe book back in doing so, good food to commence around my house :-D.
Tammy Lovellhahaha!
Yup, this lady got it right...
Yup, that'll be me and Rhian someday, lol.
As I was saying about my friend's travel company ;-)
Holy niftyness.
Woot, got the wireless up and running, finally.

For those that enjoy watching self important douchebags getting what they deserve. Inconsiderate asshole got a prompt karmic reward, enjoy.
Welcome back to the internet for me. Yay for being connected in my new house.
Just finally got into my new apartment. Interweb not up till Friday, good thing there's an Sbux across the street.
Why isn't it 3-4 yet? I want the keys to my new place.
It's official, I begin moving into my new place tomorrow. Woot woot. If anyone knows of any cheap furniture for sale, please let me know.
Georgia is way behind on the times, common city of Atlanta, catch up already. We all know that having a women topless day would be amazing... That is all :-D
I have been learning katakana all day and am starting to be able to work out Japanese words from that style of writing. It's far from pretty, but I can semi-read Japanese... I might add, the first week of my class just ended. This is going to be a LOT of work.
I freaking love my new job. Delivery driving is the shiznit yo.
Scroll down!
So very tired...
Happy bday kitter, may you enslave all of humanity in your area for the day.
Happy b-day lady, hope all has been well.
What a pig.
Trust Morgan Freeman to put it best...
Update on my cig quitting...
My original quit date ended up not happening, but not being discouraged, I quit the following day... I now have 33 hours without and am holding strong. Piece of cake.
Today's the day... No more smokes for me. Watch out Atlanta.
Everybody with me now... FUCK THE POLICE.
Sweet, sweet greeness. Love me some nifty designs like this. Straw bale houses are also amazing and SUUUUPER energy efficient.
How true.
I want a freaking smoke rawrrrrrrrrr. Fyi, I'm starting the quitting process... again.
Woot, got some life changing stuff in the works. Everyone keep your fingers crossed that everything works out as I have it envisioned in my mind.
Hehe
So, if you haven't seen the previews... Anchorman 2 is coming out, made me think of you. Hope all is well.
Yay for making a large stone sale.
With the beginning of the semester around the corner, let's start figuring out meeting time that works. I'm hunting a new job and want to be able to plan accordingly. Right now tues or thurs I have class till 2-3, don't have the sheet in front of me.
Oh yeah, loving it.
Please donate to the HOLY SHIT THIS IS AWESOME fund and help realize one Will's dream to terrorize a park in a giant robot.

Holy awesomeness.
I feel big changes ahead, the winds be a shifting.
Dear friends, remember when I was talkinga bout that bik for a b-day present... Scratch that, but don't end plans to remortgage your house just yet... I found something even cooler :-D.
So Netflix has a movie called Nude Nuns with Big guns... It's exactly what it sounds like, worst nuns ever.
I miss you Rhian, wish you were here with daddy. :(
So totally true, I do that all the freaking time.
Ok, so seriously friends, let's talk about awesome bday presents... make it happen ;-)
Well, this morning while plugging in the gelato truck, I found the extension cord had exposed wires... The hard way. Let me tell ya, my arm freaking HURTS, yet I am still alive.

Happy b-day crazy lady. Hope it's a freaking great one.
Guess who's now the owner of two kayaks... This guy.

Did you get any pics of your zombie outfit?
Hey, we need some more zombies for the movie shoot, this Thursday. We are heading down to the farm tomorrow afternoon to fish and have a good time before we have to arrive on set. If you are interested let me know ASAP. I was down there, yesterday, getting fitted for the prosthetic makeup for the scene, they are going all out. This is going to be a good time, who's coming with us/
BOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
So glad I don't feel like that these days.
Love it.
Happy B-day Ms Vicky. I hope you have a day filled with bliss, enjoy yourself.

This sounds freaking awesome, I'll see what I can do to make it.
Happy b-day dude. We gotta get together this summer, it's been too long.

Anyone on set of For Better or For Worse tomorrow? Feels good to have the time to get on set somewhere.
Yay for the first official day of summer break. Hello couch, expect to have my ass on you a lot today.
Yall missed a hell of a weekend, we caught an 8 lb snapping turtle and made some stew. It was a great time.
My poor truck is becoming a-sexual today. No more giving it blowjobs to make it run. Woot.

Happy B-day lady, hope it's a great one. I wanna get down your way to catch up, it's been a while.
Good news everybody... My phone has been found, however it was in a sneaky place, damned Oliver took it upstairs into the guest room, that bastard.
So the spot I hear my phone loudest is in the damned wall. Wtf, why me.
Still hunting for my damned phone. I am getting really frustrated with this shit.
Finding ones lost phone must be WAY easy when the damned thing is not on vibrate. Been at this shit for 3+ hours.
Well said, thanks Ryan Perry
Procrastination is like masturbation, you are only fucking yourself... But damn aren't they both fun.
Yall missed out on a wild night last night ;-), hope yall had a blast though.
Great article through the Huffington post. Enjoy.
So bad news about the farm, my parents will be there all weekend, so it's a no go. However, we CAN have people to our house as an after, after party. We'll just have to figure out how to get everyone parked.
hehe. Oh yeah.
holy awesomeness.
Here's some Christian spirit for ya.
So very true.
Ok, I plan on trying to start up a HvZ game for the first week of fall semester. Anyone that would like to help create such game please let me know. I'm starting with SSDP members as I feel that we can reach a large audience with who we are, and possibly drum up some serious interest in who we are and what we are doing. We can charge a fee of $2-$5 to enter the game, which then goes into our budget as a group. Who's with me?
Hehe, thanks Campbell's you made my soup eating complete with these directions.
Thanks Kitty, this is freaking awesome. Too bad you can't grow a beard and look the true badass ;-)
This is what happens when you try to hold on while a jet engine readies for takeoff. All I can say is ouch, she should get an honorable mention in a Darwin Award, hell they all should.
So very true. Why aren't THEY rich, and basketball/football/baseball players struggling to make ends meet. Fucked up society we live in. No wonder we are rapidly falling behind other countries in scholastic achievement.
sweet.
Heyo, ima need some ink in the near future. Getting my lady to design it up for me. Will let you know ASAP when I'm all set and ready for the tart.
Happy b-day Lori, hope it's a great one.
Happy b-day hommie, hope you have a great day full of scuba adverntures.
Writing my zombie research paper today. So glad I choose a topic that allows me to be more creative than acedemic, this was torture last semester with my choice of tax reform. Try reading tax law journals, you'll instantly feel my pain with that one ;-).
Sweetness.
:-D
Happy original zombie day everyone.
Beer is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy.
-Benjamin Franklin.

Btw Netflix has a beer documentary that is hilarious. Watch it.
FUCK YOU FAFSA. Making me pay 79.99 to file for aid, you rat bastards, best be giving a LOT more now that you are hijacking us for $$ that we need as students.
Oh Brazil, you have done it again. You have brought us yet another showing of beautiful women doing things that are just plain wrong. For more info (to those that dare) google cake farts. Consider yourself warned, it is EXACTLY what you think it is.
How effed up is THIS. Proof that the police are racist pigs and the system is FUBAR.
Wassup lady, how goes in ye olde California?
Awesome ;-)
Back home in Atlanta. Missing Az already. Can't wait to get back out there and see everyone again.
Heading back to the airport to return to Atlanta. Goodbye again AZ, can't wait to come back ASAP.

Sarah DactylI don't remember completely falling, no. 'Twasn't me. I got mad recovery skills. ;) ....except falling when the camera is NOT rolling; that's always me! haha!
I have an interesting idea to raise awareness of who we are as a group. Through my research for all my projects, this semester, I have become aware of a game called Humans Vs Zombies, that is being played on college campuses across the country. Now this affords us a unique opportunity to be hosting a really fun event that will garner attention across campus. I believe this will allow us to reach a larger audience than through tabling, as when anyone is asked what they are doing, they will tell them and, most importanly, who to speak to to get involved. This, of course, leads them back to us where we can get them signed up and tell them a bit about who we are and what we do. We, also, have the option of charging to become involved in the game, giving us a viable source of income for our chapter. Just a little food for thought. Without further ado, here's the link to the main page... check it out and lets discuss this possibility for the next semester, or over the summer.

Take that English paper. 10 sources found, check. MLA format, check. Paragraph about each done, check. Oh teacher, what was that you said about the last minute? See you tomorrow, with my finished product ;-). All in a days work for a master procrastinator.
How ya been my dear? Been a long time. Hope all is well.
:-D

If anyone knows a photographer that needs a canon imageprograf printer for less than the $3200 ticket price, I have a used one available for $1600. Please put the word out to anyone you may know.
So I go to work, after spending much of the morning puking, get asked if I can close, on a day I requested off three weeks ago, when I say I cannot, my manger tells me to go home. I'm pretty sure the asshole just fired me after showing up sick, what a dick.

Happy New Year yall. I'm hoping that the new year will bring me the time, and money, to start coming back to the dojo.

What an awesome prank.
Only a little movement, the people that were riding it choose to get off as my video started :(.
Holy awesomeness. I want one.
Rang in the new year with the most amazing party ever. I was riding a sesaw that was shaped like a big chicken, and burning to ring in the 2012. Best party ever.

Happy birthday dude.
Hope all is well with you and that your hip is feeling better. Thanks again for loaning me your extra scarf, super nice of you. See you around on set, I'm sure.

This is the set I was supposed to be working at.
Dude was awesome working with you and your various crazy faces.
So I had an idea that would just be a hell of a lot of fun. I am sure everyone here knows what planking is, but I think we should create a new phenomenon and internet craze.... Zombieing. Here's my proposal. We get as many zombies as we can, full makeup and gore, a couple cameramen and invade Walmart, Target, or some other public shopping type venue, then post on Youtube, FB, etc. Anyone interested?
Thanks for the add.
Amanda CapeI remember that photo!
Hope you have a safe ride home. Was awesome working with you.

Normon says he's flattered, but he's happy with his gf... AND that your bacon wrapping is a bit much for him. He DID laugh his ass off though.
How do y'all feel about a zombie party?
Would really like to take the night off and go to bed early.
Feels a nasty case of the T virus coming on.
This is the event I'm going to that I was unable to describe very well. maybe you relate to that kind of thing.
Can anyone think of creative ideas to get me a Redbull sponsorship.
Woot, spending much of the next 2 weeks working as a zombie.
Amber SilvereagleShe's a very cute flower. :)
Freaking awesome. T virus one is the shiz.
Looking into studying abroad, London or Ireland are on the list of possibilities, possibly France too. Opinions on which to do?

I want to see the photos from last night, was some sillyness going on.
Awesome night out at the bars, for those that were "at Churchills" yall missed a night of wild debauchery, and a sneak peak of my Halloween costume. Apparently I am now going to the TAPS party (yes like the show) ;)

Happy birthday.

Totally badass.
Yay for turn in day of my last paper... Mellow week after today.
Stupid cancer. We all want a new car, a new phone. A person who has cancer only wants one thing... to survive. I know that a lot of you "who think you're too cool" probably won't re-post this. But a very little amount of my friends will. Put this on your wall in honor of someone who died of cancer, survived, or who is fighting against it now
My daughter just said "I love you dada" via skype. I have missed a LOT.
Happy birthday Momma Dukes. Hope it's a good one. Make sure you beat your child today to make up for all the beatings he's missed by being across the big pond.
But I AM a stalker... Not sure if this will work out so well Katt.
Eassiest midterm EVER... I LOVE philosophy.

One plate of crab legs down 80+ to go.
We have a go for crab legs... PEACE!
How you feel about crab legs?

Hour and a half till my crab leg "brunch" I'm freaking HUNGRY damnit.
Buckhead Saloon, here I come... Hope you got the crab legs ready...
Hellz yeah... see you Sunday morning Buckhead Saloon... Hope you bought enough crab legs to feed my happy ass.
Had a great time at the 1873 society event last night. Wonderful benefit for the Atlanta Humane Society. Great band playing... Great times had by all.

"If you purchased $1,000 of shares in American Airlines one year ago, you would have $49.00 today. If you purchased $1,000 of shares in AIG, you would have $33.00 today. If you purchased $1,000 of shares in Lehman Brothers, you would have $0.00 today. But, if you purchased $1,000 worth of beer, drank all the beer, turned in the aluminum cans for recycling, you would have $214.00. Therefore, the best current investment plan is to drink heavily & recycle. It is called the 401-Keg Plan!!!!"

A special EFF you to all the customers that came in saying "thank you for working on xmas" (baby's first) and did NOT tip.
Rhian and I walked around the house, her holding my hand the entire way.
Day 5 no smoking still. Woot.
Well, today it's official... Rhian can walk... She just walked 1/2 way across the room.
End of day two, no smokes. Only one body to hide, for the day. Not so bad.
Day one of no smoking... Now accepting orders for hits.
Just got my GSU acceptance letter... WOOOOOOOOOT!!!!!
Back at the job, today. Not happy to be here. Who wants to go in, with me, and create something new that sells billions of $$ worth so vacation doesn't have to end??
It's a tough life. Have to get up early to feed and change the baby, then spend a day on the beach.
Finally made it all the way to Florida. Nap time, baby permitting.
HAPPY HALOWEEEEEEEEEEN!!!!!!
Rhian woke me up this morning by calling out "Dada" was awesome.
Doing two people's job, tonight. Gotta effin love it.
Is super ready to go home and see my girls.
Came into work, and in the first hour, spilt a grande late on my lower torso. Not a good way to start an 8 hour shift.
COUNTY LAWWW!!
Hey man, long as it's before the 10th, or after the 15th of next month, tis all good.
So I put Rhian in her crib, so she could take a nap, then went for a smoke... Came in, and didn't see her standing, assumed she was asleep.... And she just crawled up to me and growled.... Pretty sure she successfully climbed out of her crib.
Another exciting day at work... 2 state patrol guys got a BMW in front of the store... Looks like jail time might ensue.
Jason Bateman just came through our store. Super nice guy.
While changing Rhian, she pulled hte bottom of her onesy over her face, and held it.... Upon me saying "where's the baby?" she would quickly pull it down, and smile really big, then hide her face, again. Was hilarious.
Michelle Malenfantaaaaaw she looks like her dad eh!
Aleta WhittenAwww how cute!
Thinks it's hilarious when Rhian tries to get sneaky. go to take stuff from her, and she very quickly puts it in her mouth.... "What daddy?? There's nothing in my hand... SEE???"
Yay... Power went down. Workin in the dark.
Saw a bumper sticker that said "my child was inmate of the month at county jail."
So Rhian was on the poarch, about to eat a leaf... Mommy walks up and says "what are you putting in your mouth.." Rhian immediatly puts her hands behind her back, and dropped the leaf. Smart little bugger.
Found Rhian in the bathroom, today... Walked in, and she turned and gave me a BIG smile... Hands full of cat poo from the litter box.... Dirty baby.
DRAGON CON STARTS TODAY WOOOOOOOOOOOT!!!
Yay for free pizza tonight. wooot.
So effin slow tonight. Where the he'll IS everyone??
Another beautiful lasagna created. Can't wait to eat it.
Thawing chicken to make lasagna.... MMMM lasagna.
Rhian slept till I just woke her up... Instead of being angry about waking up, she was super happy, big smile, big stretch. Must be nice to be a baby.
We got our dragon con tickets today.. WOOOOT!!
Thank god the after school rush is over.
It's officially back to school time... Here's to crazy lines, tons of spoiled kids, and crazy mothers... Not to mention the increase in tips.
Deff not going to work, today. Got long pants and a hoodie on, and still kinda cold.
I wish I had gotten my damned shift covered, I feel like shit.
Is hurtin today, think I may be getting sick *gasp*
Is effin board outta my mind... I hate Sat close shifts.
My damned back is effin killing me.
I just kinda flipped out at the shift lead, who has done NOTHING but draw, since she came on... Was standing right next to us when a venti chai spilled, and hit Rhian with splash, who cried. And when I have gotten all my pre-close stuff done, and stop for a min says "go do something productive." like I haven't been doing my shut ALL damned night.
Rhian has learned to pull herself up to a standing position in the crib. She is mighty proud of her new talent, and was talking to use, until we got the spotlight on her.
Title says it all
So bloody tired, 2.5 hours to go... Coffee high don't fail me now.
Daddy's awake trying to get the baby settled back down. Your welcome mommy.
I freaking HATE when a day off turns into a day on.
Just one of those days.
Slow as hell, tonight.
I really want a bloody day off.
Can't believe Rhian's crawling already. Will post video soon.
Portugal had the biggest win in this world cup.... 7-0 against North Korea. What now, crazy midget communist?
What utter bullshit! USA won the match 3-2 only to have a goal taken away by a SHITTY call by a ref. WTF?????????????????? At least we tied, still out, unless England looses their next match.
Fucking migraine.
Will be cooking a skate wing, tonight. Trying some French cooking, we'll see how I do :-P.
Ivory Coast match was dissapointing, no goals.

I also need ure number gain. My phone died on me, lost all my shiz.
Please send a text to me, complete with name, so I can rebuild my phonebook. I lost all my numbers in my PoS phone :(.
During my training, at Starbucks, I learned a few valuable lessons... 1) Tasting ALL the drinks offered at Starbucks, back to back to back to back, to back, to back to back, etc will equal one HELL of a stomach ache, and probable vomit. 2) Passion tea lemonade fucking ROCKS my box. 3) No matter HOW tired you are, 4 shots of espresso is a TERRIBLE idea. A better option would be to just smoke a ton of crack.
We are heading home, NOW!!!. pictures and video coming up, soon.
WOOOT!!! Baby is here, still at the hospital, though.
We are going to the hospital, tonight, labor has started. Not leaving YET... but soon as I am told tis time, we ride. Look for pics/vid in the next day or so, soon as we get home, if i'm not DEAD from lack of sleep (already running on 4 hours)

This SHOULD be the link to our baby registry. There are a few things with rediculous amounts desired on it, due to the 10% discount we get on the items left on the registry. Figured that some of em are invaluable, and we desired the discount. :-D
Saw the scariest looking lady today at Kroger. She looked like something from a Frankenstein movie, WITHOUT BEING IN A COSTUME. I was scared coming in the door, no lie.
Atlanta folk should call me, there is 20% off at the costume store I work at, tonight. Free beer and food.
Finished my GSU application, and got it all sent in.

Neh, things have been better, and been worse. With the economy the way it is, business is VEEERY slow:(. Was actually thinking bout moving back to Atlanta, soonish, but we shall see. Would love to be able to sit down, and catch up with you, been way too long. Cool that you working in Nashville, hope that all goes well for you. Anyways, perhaps, when I get back, I'll take a rock climbing trip out your way.
no shit, how the hell have you been? been ages, would love to catch up with you, sometime.
is awww, cellie has been shut off, feeling cut off from the world
heya, good, not a whole lot, this year, new, too much to talk about on a wall, lol. been an odd road since rock point. a VERY odd road.
tis a long story, bottom line is, was planning on moving back to atlanta, not so sure if that's a good option now. Unfortunatly, this, again, means going homeless, because my family is unable to treat me with ANY form of respect OR decency. This is NOT the first time I have been faced with this decision, but hopefully it is the last. Has been the WORST year of my life, by far, and I really don't have the space, nor the energy, to get into all the atrocities that have been this year. SHIT!! how the hell are you, don't think we have spoken in many years, what's the news with you?
is SEETHING IN RAGE
is Getting ready to move back to Atlanta, YEHAW!! ETA unknown, as of yet.
is neh, lord knows what's going on with my crazy ass
hot damn, heard you had had a little one, she's precious, how old is she?
what's up dude, how the hell you been? what ya been up to? been ages since we talked.
hey there, hope all is well with you:-D.
miss angie, you transient, where the heck are you, and what ya been up to? we gotta get together, sometime, and share some stories. I am, now, living in Tucson, if you are ever down this way, lemmie know.
Sarah, been a while, tried to call a few times, where ya at? hope all is well, and that the sobriety thing is going well, for you.

Dude we straight up abandoned our bases and left the munitions. Total arms deal to back the cia’s training they received.
Ai rocks
Isn’t it a joy being in an age of mass extinction? Remember history has proven time and again that being the top of the food chain is not a good thing during these die off periods. Hold on, we’re likely going to see a real bumpy ride most likely culminating in a massive die off. It’s simple math really, the only reason we have the food to feed our overpopulation is due to oil in one way or another. Without farm equipment to plant, weed, harvest, etc we’re fucked. Saudi Arabia has the single largest oil field we’ve found to date. They just need to apply a drill and done. What kind of sign do you take it that they are starting to build deep sea drilling rigs (millions of $$ with constant repairs, unsafe conditions and isolated from rescue)? If your answer was they are running out, you’d be correct. If they are the likelihood is ALL fields are running out. We ain’t just gonna love a certain apocalyptic television show, we are likely going to watch it all crumble.
Fuck that bitch with a pitchfork
You know this site isn’t legit right? The “news” posted here may have once held a kernel of supportable claims, then it played the telephone game and now is unrecognizable from the original scientific fact(s).
Crazy right?
Kiss a ginger day.... what the fuck is that shit. I want booze, herbs and maybe some hanky panky till dawn. That should be the holiday.
if the damned words weren’t running away from the screen I’d leave something witty here. 😜
It is
We must put our heads together and work as one or stumble blindly into our own doom.
So, humanity is on the brink of a massive die of and doesn’t seem to understand what’s going on. Let me lay it out for you. Literally everything we have, is oil. It allows us to grown more (farm equipment vs hand plow, pesticides, etc), hell to have more resources period. Without the boost it gives our ability to do damned near everything (you car tire takes two barrels of oil to make alone), we simply will NOT be able to support the population. I’ll part with a couple of questions. What kind of sign do you take it that Saudi Arabia (where the largest oil field on the planet is) is now spending millions, of big billions to build deep ocean oil drilling rigs? Would you do that if you could just spend the money for the drill and labor?
Quite frankly, they are correct in a sense. As long as we are divided along so many lines we cannot all work together to start thinking about how we are going to survive ourselves.

Let alone transport them from the very rural areas they are farmed in to where you can safely purchase them.
You realize that to plant them, till them, fertilize them, and apply pesticides we use oil burning machines. Without them, we simply cannot produce anywhere NEAR enough food. Panic and mayhem WILL set the very second the majority believes there will be such.
The walking dead is right on with the showing of humanity in apocalyptic times. Once reality sets in for the misinformed and or stupid, mass scale violence WILL ensue.
Putt?
Hope the little shit gets arrested.
Funny I’ve made a similar choice. Either I have a thing for attracting bat shit crazy, it has a thing attracting me, or I make people crazy. Real shit show any way about it.
I read totally ready to have cannabis infused heavily 👍🏻
Really it’s the least of our issues as we run out of oil. Oil of course is LITERALLY everything that has allowed us (or would continue to allow us) to remain at this massive population. In other words, some real shit is going to go down.
Happy bday girlo. Ps I just hit 34, neither of us are old. Old is just a state of mind.

ALWAYS update... likely a security patch fixing some sort of attack. Pain in the ass maybe, however the need to prevent your data being stollen (you have no idea how much sensitive data they can acces. Promise it’s more than you think.)
Personally I believe Colorado is the only state that got the law right (though I haven’t first hand witnessed Alaska’s). Both Washington and Oregon sold out to big business and boned those of us that can not afford a yacht with a golden toilet. Plus following through on utilizing the law then makes you a prohibited possessor. Pretty sure that covers most of the people who would resist in one form or another.
That’s big enough to swallow you probably lol

So electricity both likes me and dislikes me, I WILL likely get hit by an arch. Considering the last time it bit me (flip flops, toes submerged in water and plugged into a wall via extension cord at work). Instead of seeing black I found myself in a full on rage, threw the cord (seriously hard to due since the muscles contacted all tense up), unplugged it and then destroyed it before going to Home Depot and replacing it before going and finishing my job.

Mine was technically my ex’s, billed as a beagle/chihuahua and with a terrible backstory. He was abandoned in an apartment for a week, still too young to be away from mommy. He came to her too little to see above a stair and with some AWEFUL separation anxiety. After something like 16k I’m destroyed items in her parents townhome when we split and she moved back in, he came over for a play date and she magically disappeared lol. He’s the best cuddle dog and as sweet as they come. He just needed some guidance. Her loss my gain.

It doesn’t take a gun to do much the same.
Don’t you find it suspicious that all of the school shootings just so happen to involve the same rifle congress has been trying to ban for a couple years?
Crazy is crazy, that shit happens in countries that banned them.
It doesn’t work anyways. Crazy is crazy.
Human nature. We all have heard of our relationship to Chimpanzees as our closest link. If you don’t know anything about Chimpanzees, they are VERY aggressive, wage war against other groups as well as pick on their weaker tribe members. Your teachers growing up were misinformed, however. We are factually more closely related to the Bonobo, a VERY peaceful animal (if you watch a video I’m gonna warn you now, they are graphic and aren’t family appropriate). They too make an aggressive show when meeting another tribe, however they make love (yes that kind) about it, not war. Frankly I think that some of us have more chimp than bonobo (think those war mongering folks or bully at school) and some of us are more like bonobos (the hippies in the 60’s and the millions marching in protest of wars since). I also find it suspicious that the SAME gun congress wants to ban has been used in ALL the shootings this year. The odds agains that are astronomical. Read up on odds if you doubt me, then do a simple hunt for how many types of guns their are.
If given one, everyone fails. They are dicks like that.
Jenn yavapai county Az. Cobb cops are fucking pricks too, not as bad as Dekal county though.
Funny that all of a sudden ALL of the school shootings used the SAME type of weapon Congress is trying to ban.
It would have been more powerful had he not messed up the second you’re. 👍🏻
Hire ex-military individuals such as yourself for various positions with a license to have hidden weapon(s). That way there’s someone on scene to stop it before it gets bad.

For the record the mana that is described most carefully as “growing with the morning dew, must be collected before it melted with the sun, must gather only for that day or it would get worms and start to stink. All of which describe mushrooms. Also a point of note, fungus (yes psilocybin mushrooms) are about all that will grow in the valley. The description of the leavened bread would equate out to near 3.5 of the substance per each of the flat bread recipes... if such a historical event DID happen (which is very unlikely), they would have potentially been eating mushrooms and just tripping balls wondering around.

Me too, for that much money I don’t care who’s potus. Cheeto or not, that fridge better give great head.
I used to get my eggs from under a chicken every morning. The only difference is they still had their protective layer and could sit on the kitchen counter vs must be kept in fridge due to washing the outer protective layer off.
Miss my hens. Nothing like farm fresh eggs.
God I love these types of bets lol.
Them shoes coming off the ground would give a tell tale sound. The sound would easily indicate direction of the perceived attack. A blind person’s entire world is sound. Just saying.

First off, hemp and cannabis are from TWO DIFFERENT PLANTS. Way to start off 100% misinformed, sire the rest is liable to be solidly reliable facts. So how could fields of hemp viably become the solution for tomorrow?? Textiles, paper, textiles, building supplies are just some of the many industries that the plant could viable boost industrial trade for. plus the high rate of carbon dioxide to O2 conversion helps stem the depleting ozone due to logging the Amazon rainforest. Your move 😜👍🏻

Sorry girlo
Russ if it’s actual absinthe the thujone in the wormwood gets the hell out of you too. Used to make my own legit Oldschool recipe absinthe back in the day. Two cups of the traditional sugar cube recipe got me to another level.
Do do lemon water often though 😜
i still like my “not being a pussy” treatment. 😜
Walked around the streets of Portland observing them in their natural habitat.
So full of rawer. You wear the war paint well
Solid plan
Yup, it’s been bad this year for sure
The rest of the banks aren’t much better, they stick it to the hard working and low paid to make themselves a massive profit one and all.
Yeah, I went through them. The credited my account the $1600, decided it was not fraud and took the funds back when I had a low account, overdrafting the account, which they then racked on a mess of fines.
In other words, they literally stole more than the thief did.
They are crooks IMO. Fined me and feed me to the tune of another $2000 after allowing my money to be taken .50-$1 at a time to Spain (another $1600).
They decided I was swiping my card in Spain. Interestingly enough I have a blank passport. Fuck Bank of America.

I smell what you’re stepping in, but the uber cool kids also know of Sarduakar and maybe grok in fullness.

Not helping your hide a body though 😜
If Oregon is anything like Az, walk in with your id, walk out with your piece.
The store version they add sugar when they bottle it so the living bacteria ferments further, creating the carbonation. It’s decent. Save the last third of a store bought bottle and brew your own, but do not bottle it. It’s like a super crisp tea and incredible.
On a serious note, holy fuck nuts. A lot has happened while I was on “vacation.”
Been thinking about it since I saw an article on black market prices.
You too
Didn’t even break a bone, real bad bruise to the bone from the under steering column airbag. Fucker had a metal casing. It hurt like fuck for days.
I take “not being a pussy” and allow my body to develop natural immunities. If you aren’t really young (infant to toddler) or really old you’ll just feel like hell and get over it.
“I’m sorry, you son suffered from a severe case of stupid and is therefor dead. My condolences.” 😜
Remove the warning labels and just start pronouncing the cause of death as “being stupid.”
True story, friend of mine answered my phone “crying” and gave them the news saying she just found my phone at her house. Lol
A few of mine thought I died for a few years. 😜
Omg her silkies are too cute. I wanna get those and polish crested next chicken run.
Just THC and let me tell you, I’ve been crippled stoned, munchies so bad I considered eating my arm off. Couldn’t get off the couch though, so running someone down to eat his/her face was totes outta the picture

Truth
“Man up” is the worst thing we could ever say to a child. It teaches them the “men don’t have feelings” mentality. The mark of a real man is an ability to think past what his dick says to him and convey a world of thoughts, dreams and feelings with his words. I DO rather enjoy the idiots though, they make it easy to get ladies for those of us who have more going on than what out penis “thinks.”
Lol
Bout how my life goes
This is a winning quote 👍🏻. I have long said I support our troops by wanting them out of harms way so a billionaire can get richer. The endless war game needs to end, problem is war makes a shit ton of money.
Probably wouldn’t have gone as well for me had the other driver been going near the speed limit. As it was it freaking hurt.
Woot
I apparently “fart all day long” forgot to get my beano when they took me I guess lol
Had dude not been coming out of a parking lot or side street (only saw him when he rammed me) and had instead been up to the speed limit it would’ve been a MUCH different situation. Either way it happened with an ambulance as witness so I had possibly the fastest response time ever lol.
They are basically a claymore with padding instead of ball bearings. They also never appeared to inflate fully which supports a loss of consciousness IMO.
Upon replaying the accident in my head potential of being unconscious for a second, but to the amazement of all witnessed (including the EMT’s from an ambulance), just injured from the metal housing from the airbag hitting my shin. Years of soccer turned them into iron, got out of the car and walked it off.
It’s the moments of mortal peril I feel truly alive. Like a drunk I walk out with little to no damage cause I fully relax. The under steering airbag gave the worst of my injuries. Metal casing around the airbag directly to the shin. Not sure if I lost consciousness for a second, I surmise I did (airbag at what 200mph to face). From my perspective he hit my driver side door (so there’s the scratch missing from my timeline).
Damn man. Only hit one deer (on the move out at ~75). I have Jedi reflexes though and picked the right way to veer to give it a glancing blow and 0 damage sustained.
Police report will confirm conditions beyond my control and the other driver being entirely at fault. As there was a gas station literally right there I have witnesses too. Pretty sure I won’t need one, but if I do he’ll love me as a client. Everything he needs to crush them prepped already.
Especially when it’s the universe lol

I’m gonna go out on a limb and suggest that when it’s your guy friend youre thinking about... maybe 😜
Once the ladies started getting frisky with each other, the night took a very welcome turn lol
Was when I lived in Az. Sent their husbands back home in a cab I paid for with their money (they shouldn’t have made stupid bets in bars, just saying) and the wives still wanted to dance and drank. The bottles in my hotel room came in handy that night haha
Idk man... I out lasted 5 chicks partying out in Az. Epic 24 hours really lol
Perhaps you think too much about butt sex 🎃
Must be dull on your wall then 👎🏻
Well for Lola every hug is free. 😈

Good job
I’m still in awe of the scene where dumbledoor slaughtered Kylo. #epic
I’m alive but Fuck the end of 2017, it seriously needs to cut the shit
Well said
No problem
So awesome I took it upon myself to spread cross film spoilers to try to hide real ones.
It was awesome.
Yay hydroponic. Looks like deep water with a feed to the root base.
Duuuuuude just wait till you see Dumbledoor kill kylo ren, suuuuper sick scene.
Speaking of which, these all clear pipes for $90+ are priced too high too. Fools and our money.
It’s cool, but the materials cost like $100-$200 tops. They are insane
I’d pay to see that. Best pay per view ever 👍🏻👍🏻
Won’t get one from me. Well, just one. Professor Snape kills Kylo Ren. It was brutal
Seriously, I’ve had more than one ex try to kill me. Literally kill me
Good for you. I’ve found thst strong, independent women such as yourself are truly gems and about as rare. Then again I’ve been forced to conclude that Either I may ladies crazy, or I attract the hell out super crazy ladies. Lol
^^ good riddance
Lol too cute.
Guess you’ve just queued me in on yet another reason I’m glad I’m a guy. Then again, women get “judged” by their body, men by their job/wallet.
George, note that even in the link it says opinion which may be BASED on fact, however opinions are like assholes, we all got em and they all stink 😜
Let’s just say I rather enjoyed being a pain in the arse in trade chat lol
still betting it can be accomplished. You have no idea how many “permanent” bans I got with my World of Warcraft account back in the day.
Fuck what other people think. Never understood that social convention.

Just going to say you sound like my type LOL
Had to do it for one of my online Photoshop classes
The funny thing is you can take a really fat chick and make her look like that with Photoshop
Fashion trends with women is Justin sorry to me in the 80s we wanted shoulder pads in them to look like linebackers and now apparently we want the narrow hips that looks not feminine
Because hips on a woman is not natural *rolls eyes*
Pretty sure you can fix that
Exactly. Plus sized and ribs showing fails to compute to me
Exactly
Woot
Dude that whole industry is body shaming. Had a gf I consistently wanted to give sandwiches to they called plus sized. She was like 105 and 5’10” and needed to loose inches to get pro signed. Kate Moss was there that day, watched her eat an entire large pizza in a semi related note lol
Right
Wow man, if you have anger like that over a toddler, go seek someone to talk to.
those nails though haha
Continuing to be a thorn in the side of what we suspect was a human trafficking ring to get my ex safely away, all while under threat of serious bodily harm.
I did no such thing 👍🏻
Scotty not even close to who I voted for. 👍🏻
Took your crazy pills this morning huh.
Actually Sophia the scientific research done in the 80’s has been 100% correct. I presume you aren’t familiar with the actual findings which stated that both the heat in summer and how cold it gets in winter would change drastically, both directions. Common misconception since the media blares out a lot of opinions on it, but little on what the study concluded.
And I insult him and his intelligence (plus that of the fools that voted him in) as often as possible.
Turn it off and put it inside a ziplock bag with rice inside. The rice wants to reheydrate and will pull any water out. Technology often reacts poorly to being under freezing conditions.
I will also state, the twacko’s end up all over the damned road there. Don’t look before changing lanes with their bikes, or are in all black in the middle of the effin road. Seriously nearly took a bunch of em out myself.
of course it was 99, hated coming outta my driveway. Those asshats fuckin fly down that road.
Has now read the replies. That’s terrible. Where did it happen?
What happened?
Omg girl you’re killin me over here.
I’d be so game 😜😜😑
Cough cough... trump

glad your in an up. may it continue to get better and better.
Indeed she is gorgeous.
Also what was said above me.
Let’s face it, if guns become outlawed then only criminals will have them, the black market only grows with prohibition. Plus are we really stupid enough to literally fall for Nazi tricks? Once Hitler had the people’s guns, they got turned on the people. Not saying the US gov would, but judging by the current state of our country, it’s a distinct possibility.
😝 well played good sir. As I said, heavily armed
I post what makes me laugh duder. No offense meant to anyone. I keep those that would indeed be heavily armed in my circle. 👍

Lol. Hope all is well man
It felt like hours of pushing and straining before I got it out. Upon gazing at its majesty, I flushed 😜

You have no idea girlo
Yeah, she had a killer life though. Peed on well over half the states. 👍👍
It was past her time, it had to be done. I though she would give me the “I’m ready” look, but she always was the dutiful one and it became clear she was just feeling her duty to be by my side.
Have you ever been in a theater department?? See many straight men??? Remember screen is merely another type of theater.

The thought is there duder, problem is I got like a million projects going and can only do so much at once before total shutdown.
retail is already getting uber busy with the early shoppers.
do it now and etsy
duuuude.... great idea

And you know that small pox was nearly eradicated prior to the silly anti-vax bit all based off of a grand misunderstanding of science by a majority of the population. Don't get me wrong, many (if not most) of our pharmecutcsls are crap that only passed because those on the deciding panel invest lots of personal money into the research on it. Take Zoloft and Wellbutrin for instance. Both had probable increased suicidality amongst the group of guinea humans. It's been a minute since I read the research, but I believe it was 25% of higher of the trial group attempted suicide and two succeeded. Please leave me out of these, a deep love of science and lots of reading prevents me from falling pray to this hysteria.
Looks like someone needs tongue therapy to me 😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝

Next time I'm back home, bottle of rum and a long over due game of catch up.

also, FBI has concluded 0 connection to ISIS, though they are still looking. President Trump is still not responsible enough to tell the truth. Probably not tie his own shoes, dress himself, or wipe his own ass either.
no, he was the most successful shooter to date.
it is my pleasure Alice. Good on you for not buying into American policy of being scared of learning. Personally, the day I stop learning new things I will consider myself already dead.
All laws side with the business over the person affected (or if they don't all attorneys serve the business as i found when in a landlord tenant dispute over a broken AC in a rental that their tech just sprayed Freon in to make it appear as if they had effected an actual repair).
Georgia as a whole is pretty damned dirty which is why corporations flocked there during the economic downfall under Bush. many of them doing so leaving other states (which helped make the entire thing worse, of course).
just wait till dabs become the thing there :P. we can get a product that's 99.9% thc here :P
while also having a medical marijuana law that requires crossing state lines to get your medication and bring it home... Of course the Republican that wrote the law has graciously agreed to get and bring your medication back (a violation of federal law and literally making him the MM kingpin).

There is no reason many of these folks are still on the street other than our wasted tax dollars paying for police and a legal system that will allow someone caught with two felony weapons charges, meth and burglary to be out to get arrested again for 4 more felonies a month later, let alone STILL out two months later to threaten to come back and steal all someone's stuff when caught trespassing and told tweakers aren't allowed on the property (personal experience).

I see this as another sign. If Az passes such, it'll be a bought law in both states. This is merely the beginning IMO. They want these kind of laws in Oregon, it's most certainly because this is literally the most likely first state to start the citizen return of aggression, followed by Az. Both have VERY liberal gun laws and would not be easy to take by force because of such.
I've said since long before the election that the way things are headed it's a photo finish between ww3 or revolutionary war 2 (crypto currency becoming illegal will have hit all the checkmarks for the causation the first time. History what's itself?).
I think you should mention adults that do this too. I know at least one that has admitted to such. Suuuuper sad IMO

From what I could read from the Oregonian, the parents weren't stimulating the child by reading to it, etc. playing with a kid is all fine and good, but it seemed like since they hadn't set up a network to assist with the learning needs of a child (though I'm sure it was highly hinted at during the time leading up to the child being taken).

Also, where did you get from iq requirement that NO children would be born? Cause a requirement for breeding means that it IS allowed and kids WILL happen. Forgot to think about the wording or what?
Group: Lane County Mugshots Uncensored
You realize that we have been in an age of mass extinction for the past 20 years, right? What is your child going to eat when out food supply dwindles to the point that ONLY the rich can afford to eat? Do you really want to watch your child wither and die from starvation? Mkay so who's having trouble with their thinking?
Group: Lane County Mugshots Uncensored
If the world is going to ultimately be destroyed to the point of millions of human deaths due to starvation and disease (mother nature's defense against overpopulation), then I'd pose you're pretty asinine for thinking no harm can come.
Group: Lane County Mugshots Uncensored
With two considerations, the fact t that we are horribly overpopulated and already have too many issues of people going hungry. as well as stupid people breeding like wildfire. I am all for iq requirements for being allowed to have children. Stupid people will never have a solution for the many environmental issues we face. Our strongest asset and defense is our capacity to think. So the combination means we necessarily NEED to put our energy and resources in ensuring we have enough really smart people to be able to figure out a way to survive the age of mass extinction we are already in (and have caused).
Noticed it in eugene too
Again, you are seriously stupid. Best way to cure that is drinking the shit under the kitchen sink.
Jason again, you are stupid if you believe that being one of the three countries not in the treaty, both of the other two are third world countries (Syria and Nicaragua). In other words, we are what is making the world have issues.

Yup, understand that in my lifetime we're fucked. Yeah. I totally do. Outside the box would mean thinking differently than the way things are now. Aka, you are incapable of doing so #dumbass
Keep letting the rich kill the thing that is factually giving us the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat and having jobs is the least of our concern.
Jason yup, now I am positive that you are incapable of reaching logical conclusion through thought.
Right? My point exactly. The reason white folk don't talk about a proud cultural history is due to the terrorist organization known as the church.
Jason, it's pretty simple. The regulations that he's getting rid of are regulations because of environmental impact. If you cannot understand that with no trees we start having a hard time breathing then your vote for trump makes sense (though I believe I have evidence to show why prior). The reason the rest of the world is right to hate us is cause we chose greed in a rush to help the rich understand they cannot eat money. The rest of the world is less stupid (and yes I have evidence to show we fail with intelligence, schooling and are #1 in military spending and imprisoned population only) and understands this without needing to find out first hand. Understand when ww3 breaks out, idiots who voted to elect this Buffon caused it m. Arguably, I think there's enough Fb people smart enough for that basic understanding here. People fed up with the 1% getting all the breaks and the working class paying a majority of the taxes that only go to help the people NOT paying theirs. In other words, it very possibly could end up as the second revolutionary war. Unfortunately for you and many other fools, you've put yourself directly aligned with the group the WORLD will be after. I advise actually learning how to critically think and spend time evaluating your own morality before it's too late.

Or be responsible for civil war 2
Right, morons elected a man that is going to ENSURE that the rest of the world will consider attacking us for being greedy and not caring that we have closed the garage door and are making everyone sit in while we run our car. In other words, necessarily from his pulling out of the environmental protection treaty, we will end up killing the world around us (arguably, we're in an age of mass extinction and it's already too late).
It will also do 0 good except for making legal cannabis smokers who have enough sense to recognize that the person breaking into their house will likely be carrying at least one gun regardless of a ban and that smith and Wesson delivers service WAY faster than the boys in blue arrive.
The only reason they would consider making weed legal is to end the potential of second amendment rights resulting in revolutionary war 2.

So the DA had the class b felony theft of a companion animal (my cat) against the same neighbor that totaled my car. The photographic evidence that my cat was the one trapped and dumped on the side of the highway (also illegal) was put into the officer's hands BY the thief. In other words, it couldn't have been an easier win, yet the DA dropped the case. This is entirely the problem. If they keep dropping solid felonious cases, they allow say another felony to happen (hit and run).

As I was injured and had to go to the hospital and seek chiropractic care, it goes from a class c felony (or a 5 year max presumptive) to a class b felony (a 10 year max presumptive. Now as the federal government gives states $450k for every year every individual is locked up his cry of "we don't have the budget to convict" fell on deaf ears. I explained the math to him about he was crying a pretty pathetic sob story. 450,000x10=$4,500,000 awarded to the state and a still outrageous $2,250,000 at the 5 year max. In other words, the reason every other state over convicts is a monetary reason. These guys don't do their job, so therefore their budget is shite.
PS, still no growth or sales allowed so the law necessitates breaking federal law (crossing state lines) to bring your medicine home. I should also mention the guy that created the law has made public offers to get it FOR people. Frankly, I see that as locking anyone else out of dealing and resent him for posing such a shitty law that so directly can benefits the guy that wrote it.

though one can order it from a number of online stores and as a majority of them extract from the same plant one makes hemp necklaces from, there would be damned close to 0 THC in it, making it a hemp product, NOT a cannabis product. Legally defined a hemp crop must have less than 0.3% THC in your COMBINED harvest. How that could rank as illegal anywhere confuses me. I think the sticking point with the illegality cry is that people expect that CBD oil must necessarily come from the cannabis plant, which is 2000% false. Sadly, the hemp plant's lack of THC does make it an inferior medicine, there is something important in the combination that is far more actively going to fight the plethora of disease cannabis is recognized as a viable treatment for. Also, Georgia was literally the first state to legalize cannabis medicine (though you didn't know it). A program got voted in with very complicated requirements to be approved for the medicine just short of the Drug War (war on citizes *cought*) was declared. Since it was now deamonized, they never set the budget for the program, but also never took it off the books.

Only thing I've been able to figure out is the police's catch and release program allowing these idiots to get arrested for a violent crime with a weapon and multiple drug charges and yet STILL not being in jail a month later to get yet another 4 felony charges and yet STILL be allowed out so they can say threaten harm against someone else (literally happened to me within the past two months).

Sounds about right for the large number of shit show people around here. Summer I landed was the summer two kids (adults still living with mommy and daddy) killed them and put them in a freezer of something of the like. Seriously, how did so many of the population get allowed to become such trash.

Yeah, immediately do a virus scan. The odds of 10 women you know same dude are beyond astronomical unless and only unless it is a bot (which indicates hacker cause what other benefit does that bot accomplish other than serving a file that can easily contain malware to that many people you know). Immediately act as if you have knowingly held malicious software.
It's also a world where it could be considered illegal to be alive as there isn't a single person (certainly in this country) that can go through life without violating a single law (either through ignorance or intent).
The funny thing is there ARE options that increase the likelihood of entirely breaking an opioid addiction that are, of course, illegal in America due to it being a psychedelic therapy (lookup ibogaine therapy, it has over 60 years of success to back it's claim if you have doubt). Don't let the fact that you're taking a drug to end an addiction turn you off to the idea, just by taking it the immediate success rate is roughly 50/50, dropping closer to what you expect for rehab's success rate with the aftercare portion. I presume because of rehab center's predisposition to tell light users for whom their low used compared to other "addicts" has become a problem they choose to attempt to deal with, "come back when you have a real problem." Admittedly the first time I heard that I was sent to rehab for cannabis, but every time after that (personal experience or related via someone that wanted change before it became crippling) it was failure to assist someone BEFORE it got bad. If that's what they consider their job, judging those who need help by how deep they found their rock bottom, no wonder the success rate is minimal. IMO that's proof of caring about green, not the patient.
That kinda encompasses not wasting time for a dick, though I would encourage that as much as I have decided that a girlfriend is a complete waste of my time, money and effort currently.
I was not surprised by the result found in the least bit.
Direct violation of the judge's first amendment right, end of story. Pretty sure I see you use that same right as often as you can (religion, speech, etc all first amendment). You're not thinking clearly if you are in support of loosing that one (bout the last we have due to the idiots willingness to sacrifice their civil rights for the illusion of safety).

The answer is both. Sure there is predisposition, but with the proper nurturing one can learn how to overcome some, if not many of the things nature brought to the table. Through nurture (more the lack thereof), I was a VERY angry child. I blacked out into blind rages and would come to with shit smashed up, etc. I pose that some was through the MANY medications I was forced to take from 5-18 (ran the gamut starting with ADHD, then depression, then bipolar...). The fucked up part of my childhood trauma (most of the 5 boarding schools I went to, particularly one that has documentaries about how bad it was) is what helped me become better adjusted and not liable to flip out over something stupid (like my parents). The point obviously supports my argument that nurture (which I got more of at the school than home) changed the way that I would've turned out. Anger is an emotion I barely feel anymore (or perhaps my perception of my anger changed considerably). This doesn't mean I do not get angry, just usually cut the emotional coaster before I reach full blown pissed. When I tell people you wouldn't like me when I'm angry, I mean it exactly like Bruce Banner did. It's the only thing i fear, to be honest.
This may not be terrible, he is now telling the police to violate the constitution. In other words, this is solidly a nail in his impeachment coffin. Then again, Pence and the rest of his staff need to drop dead first lol
The legacy is more than that, it's also a LOT of "tell me about the rabbits George."

I mean, people get emboldened by the disconnect a computer allows. They can say/do anything with little fear of repercussion (like being punched). I'd also like to point out that gender has little to do with what I've already said. I believe you remember when my comments went fucking awful for 6 hours, while I was at work and not able to do anything. I WOULD imagine celebs get more dick pics than the average women, as well as many other forms of harassment. I personally just love the reactions these poor, unwitting fellows reading the hate have.

Sooooo, exactly he didn't race a shark for the same reason I didn't hug chewbaca.
not even close. He raced nothing and then they added a shark to the video. That's like saying the photoshop work I did where I seamlessly added my photo to a cewbaca hug means I hugged chewbaca. See how ridiculous the notion is that they are the same thing is?
I'd love to see your supporting evidence in how "racing a shark" includes swimming by himself so they can impose a digital shark. Pretty sure you ain't got a damned thing.
Which is EXACTLY what this post is about. Technically false advertising is a potential lawsuit win, clearly with 0 shark that is undeniably what that statement was.
so then perhaps it shouldn't have been advertised falsely as "racing a shark."
Ps... let's do easy math for a second to calculate the odds of "god," "allah," or really any other name for god is not just an advanced alien species. Now, we have an infinitely expanding universe, with an infinite amount of galaxies as a result, which would then mean that the odds of such being true rate out to getting to play infinitely. This of course means the odds of winning are infinite (remember you have an also an infinite number of chances to be right, therefore the result is inevitable). For those that don't understand betting or odds, this is what's that is called is a sure fire bet. I'm curious to see if an argument can beat math, if the equation works it necessarily works always.
Also, I frankly think he's right to some degree. We the people need to turn off the tube and have a little revolution so we can maybe say end police state America, bailouts to the rich, corporations being "people" and able to buy presidents, the central banking system, the list goes on and on.

States get $450k per person, for every year they are in jail. Assuming max sentence for the class B felony (10 yeas) 450,000 x 10 is over 4 mil worth of budget they were too lazy to get.

You are likely thinking of ALD-52 which is almost indistinguishable from its illegal counterpart and is expected to be a prodrug (you body metabolizes what does not make it LSD, thereby internally converting it to the real deal). There are a number of legally gotten compounds with similar effects potentially still on the open market from China (AL-LAD, ETH-LAD, 1P-LSD, etc)
Group: ACIDMATH
Asshole and a half taxing like that. Bad enough I suspect it's a RC instead of the real deal
Group: ACIDMATH
Only if you enter with the understanding you've gotten "custy" pricing and are being ripped off. Especially since the probability is that it is a research chemical in the first place. FYI, analogue chemicals (one that have similar effects) can be ordered from china for like 1 penny per hit. One way or another, it's a gouging.

What the trash parts of chicken become... more food
Male and female ducks (my breeding pair). In the next couple of years it'll be a renewable duck meat harvest.
The leftover meat prepared into ready to use portions. 9 small bags ready for soups, salads, etc (likely a couple days food each bag), 1 frozen bag of premade chicken salad and one in my fridge, 1 large bag of shredded chicken (at least 5 more of the small bags) and a quart of some killer chicken stock (properly jarred). Plus two whole chickens still uncooked in the freezer and TONS of crab bait.
Homegrown chicken turned into a soup stock... be jealous, it's delicious as hell.
They have access to the outside, but prefer lying next to the food and water
These chickens are the meat birds, 2.5 months old and WAY bigger than anything else in the flock. ~5-6lbs each bird.

Trying to get the sheriff to do more than call the unlicensed, undocumented citizen that driveably totaled my car in a hit and run (serious cosmetic damage Over the bluebook value, does still run). For the record, hit and run with injury is a class B felony with a mac of 10 years. Since the IS gov pays $450k per every year a person is behind bars, the max budget addition they lost totals. If we the citizens continue to allow them to take our money and NOT do their fucking job, shit like this will continue.

Which is funny by cause Molly literally means pure mdma and ecstasy is an active dose of Molly pressed with a cutting agent, often times cocaine, heroin or meth. Pretty sure that makes this a pretty unsound and invalid argument. What IS happening is the introduction of research chemicals AS the intended chemical, precisely why I call them "NOT drugs." Not legislated against, not what they are sold as, dangerous all around. Point is, if you just take what some shady dude sells you without knowing a damn thing about it, it will indeed be dangerous. Why??? Cause you have no clue what adverse reactions to anything you may or may not be prescribed or regularly interact with.

I've heard the budget claim thing before, but funny story, if you do your job and put dangerous criminals in prison you get $450k per year they are in jail from the federal government.

"My girls are absolutely, unequivocally free-range..." what is the miscommunication?
Group: What's Going On In Cottage Grove, Oregon
Also, the industry standard is disgusting.
Group: What's Going On In Cottage Grove, Oregon
To be able to legally declare "free-range" the factory farm chicken must be given merely the option to go outside, as in one door in the warehouse leading to a small yard. As you can imagine only maybe 20-30 chickens near the door make it outside as they don't have much room to move. My chickens have a yard so safe I don't close the coop at night. All of them spend the day outside foraging and getting a diverse blend of food. My girls are absolutely, unequivocally free-range by legal standards with well more space per bird than they need.
Proud to say I have been able to do all of those things since I was 12 👍

Seriously, I've never been there and remembered longer than walking in the door lol
Straight up, he's too high to remember any coaching and just took the money to be a black man next to Trump to attempt to ease black tensions.
Me too, it's priceless. He ain't got shit to say back.

Also you pay that much because your LOCAL representatives refuse to play ball with Obamacare (supposed to be state funded) leaving the people who pay for their own insurance to split the difference. In other words, the money you already paid for governmental aid (taxes) doesn't cover Obamacare, your insurance company gouges you and then covers the others. Fire your local reps and get ones that support Obamacare and the problem ends 👍👍
You realize that Obama can do no such thing himself, right? I presume you also understand that the government got shut down with his original proposal meaning his original bill got gutted to become what it is.
Truth,
Totally bs that he made a first attempt to bring us up to the same standards of healthcare that ALL other first world countries have. The problem there wasn't his intention, the problem was again the douchebag republicans in congress that would've blocked him from using the bathroom, if they could've. Your local government is why the health care sucks in your state. They pinned the costs on the taxpayers who already paid for such things by paying their taxes.
Dude we been close to another Cold War for the past 4-5 years. Dated the daughter of two NSA agents stationed in Poland and spying on the Russians. They also totally knew about the Boston Bombing and had notified family 4 days prior to the event (retirement contract was involuntarily extended which can only happen under crisis/war)
Time to show them how well a one legged woman does in an Ass kicking contest
The 'socialist jew' was by far our best choice sadly.
Ps... have a look at all he did very well for us, even with all the Republicans blocking him at every turn possible.

Trey, mayhaps you haven't heard the saying "gotta spend money to make money." The thing about the deficit is that our government takes every dollar in circulation at a loan for an amount that doesn't exist till they take out a higher loan. In otherwords that's like saying we have billions but owe zillions ALWAYS.
Kick the swelling's booty
Dude calling a prediction of the future bs indicates you have a problem understanding that guesses are based off more than personal belief. What made O's terms so difficult was the complete refusal of the republicans in the senate to work with him. Any time a group project is met with one party trying and the rest trying to fuck it up, it'll go poorly.
Too cool

Good thing I have a naughty meme instead lol
Are you trying to get pictures of male parts? I feel like this may result in more than a few bad photos lol.
Though the argument could be made that since a woman can abort without needing the father's acceptance that men should be able to choose to have no part and not have to pay the rest of their lives. I've know a few guys stuck paying cause some crazy bitch poked holes in the condom.
It's a fake

Prep up some sfx that are hideable under nice Sunday clothes, milling around before church meet as many folks as I can, befriend as many as I can and then as mass is called have the sfx go off as I 'attempt' to enter the church, bust into demonic tongues and see what happens lol
Yup, pulls them heart strings don't it

Checked after your comment, the answer is unknown, though 'with a boy' is similar to the Portuguese translation "see what happens with your brother," though that makes very little since.

In quick order I had three national guards with their MP-5's pointed at me, safety off, finger's on the trigger. As it was a situation of you may kill me, but you and your buddies will too, I started talking shit. "What the fuck am I gonna do with these, file the captain's nail past the quick?" Lol. They weren't amused

Ps, with all probability that message was an attempt to get your IP address (which can be pulled through Facebook chat). If you don't want your private ip to be visible the only real solution is to get yourself established under a VPN. The cool thing about being on a VPN is that all devices connected to it will be able to communicate as long as they can touch the internet. The screen cap shown is from my iPhone's signal, 300 miles from home, taking over my computer AT home, ultimately to make it send me a PDF to reprint. My IP address never touches the internet anymore meaning a hacker would have to break through multiple layers of protection before being able to compromise my internal network.
Never gotten one of those
Fuck man, I'm impressed
Little word of advice, a hacker can use your social media to generate a targeted list to use in password cracking. If you have strong net use practices, they can simply pick out of your top group of friends and compromise them and send you an innocuous looking anything and have you too. It's not direct from Fb, however it does give a good idea of your likes, dislikes and those who you would be more likely to get through. Ps... be wary of shortened hyperlinks, one can inject a Js code in it and have you.

this is why i was 100% ALWAYS in support of Disney taking it from Lucas.
2033 is us hitting the point of literal no return, all ice caps melted, all arctic species gone, etc. Then again, that data was prior to the Fukushima nightmare (still leaking 300 tons/day).
It may not save the world, but it would give us longer than the 16 years we currently have to figure out the issue.
Which could likely be slowed if we planted more than we killed. To be more specific we need to plant lots more plants with a high CO2/O2 conversion. Cannabis/hemp ranks as one of the better choices, IMO. It has a huge conversion factor, is easily renewable and replaces many eco unfriendly businesses like textiles, building supplies, paper, etc.

however correct that it IS just a theory, however a moron in his lack of understanding of what the difference between a theory and a scientific theory that has been repeatable every time the experiment was done.
:P
no... not a moron, it is a theory. He however clearly has no concept of the differece between scientific law (which equates down to mathematics) and a scientific theory (which can be 100% always repeatable but as long as it doesn't break down to math, it will always be a theory).

It would be really hard to prosecute a student standing in the road in front of school exercising their first amendment rights. I'm sure in police state America they might be able to pull some bs charge, but it likely wouldn't go anywhere and equate out to a violation of constitutional rights (not a lawsuit they want to deal with).
Oh, so it's cool to blatantly disrespect a black man, but protesting a sexist, racist asshole isn't cool. Yay double standards
And technically they are AT school still so not truant
But it is not breaking laws to peacefully assemble, nor protest.
If you can't avoid them, I'm betting your license should be taken and or some seriously upgraded glasses/lasik.
I'd like to see you drive and miss that crowd lol.
Which they are exercising
So they still have rights
Reel it in girlo.
That means that your son was out defending these students right to speak freely and have a right to free assembly. You know, the amendment so important that it's the first.
Actually it's called the first amendment to the constitution. The same right that allows you to say whatever you want about the sexist, bigoted prick now slated to run our country.

Right?! Sure a man named Jesus probably DID live, however messiah he was not, miracles he never performed. Otherwise one of the historians of the era would have written of him to preserve his deeds. Instead a book was written 200 years after he allegedly lived, when no one alive would remember or know of his existence due to the complete lack of any writings they could have used to recreate the story. In other words, the Bible necessarily is a work of fiction.
A historical figure that never had any historians of the time document his life other than proven forgeries by the Vatican.

And I can say that I don't have work today, that doesn't make it true. How many things do you believe that our government tells the media?
Federal and local are two different things and it sure wouldn't surprise me with our proclivity to shoot brown people for the resource that pipe is supposed to carry.
And or it's being covered up, for the first time I've had serious reason to doubt snopes
Again, if I hadn't seen this rider speaking live on a break from work I would likely be on The Snope line. Sadly, I now believe that Snopes is part of the agenda setting to assist the pipeline's construction vs actually embracing journalistic integrity.

I really wanna get out there with a video camera and start filming this shit. Seriously I hope Putin comes to our rescue. That crazy Russian is the only one to call the false flag bs for what it is, as well as the clear human rights violations we currently are embracing as a country. All violations of the NATO sanctions we helped create. Only a crazy Russian with nearly as many nukes as us COULD be the one, but with China at his back he wins. Namely because in all eventualities China wins. Humans in 1000 years will ALL look Chinese. China wins.
Amazing timing for sure. I wouldn't be surprised if a white buffalo showed up at this point. Gia is speaking.

I think either way we're going to get bent over as more of our liberties become available only to corporations and our military continues to violate the NATO sanctions we helped make. It'll be a small wonder if Putin and or our allies don't come liberate us from a government factually committing human rights and civil liberties violations on those it is sworn to protect.

Chemical is not that nuclear that we went in there for. Plus they might be able to arm it on a missile, but they cannot reach more than a couple hundred miles, thus failing to be a danger to the American public by several thousand miles.

Your daily dose of really effin weird 👍👍
I left Washington a month or two before thousands of legal business had to close down for good due to legislation change.
I tell every legalization movement I see what I have witnessed. I have been to all the legal states, but Alaska and have worked in the industry in two of them. Colorado is he only law worth a damn, if you had a legal business you automatically got your rec license on top of the existing license. No small businesses were closed due to inability to pay insanely high fees, or due to the people tasked with making a new law, rather than tampering with an already working law in practice, doing the exact opposite. A vote of legalization merely puts cannabis directly into the hands of corporations that have been lobbying against it's legalization for decades. In other words, all one might see is victory for the movement by voting yes, however in practice it becomes less victorious and more shady. Do NOT vote legalization until both Oregon and Washington can repeal the mess that the greedy fucks have made of our laws and set a stronger precedent for future states to follow in Colorado's steps.

It's been a while, yes. However, it does not HAVE to come from a hemp plant, it simply must contain under .03% THC

Likely allergy related or something.
Kimberly to go along with that, look into the advances in textiles, clothing, building materials and even gasoline that you can use your garbage for. It's through farms like yours that we can begin to make an impact on the damage we have so willingly allowed in favor for convenance and ease in our society. If we are going to survive ourselves (and it's both and IF and a WHEN at this point), It'll be through the hard work of dedicated farmers planting more than we are cutting down, slowing the need for deforestation (a majority of which is happening in the forest that supplies 25% of the earth's total oxygen. Cannabis or hemp is a fantastic co2 to o2 transmitter. In other words, we can extend our when by small amounts (read we are currently experiencing an age of mass extinction, it's going to get much worse very quickly) by planting large fields that help balance the toxins in the air. Sadly this is still a small part of our problem, but still worth the effort
Kimberly if your state is legal to grow hemp look into the laws. The probability is the total THC content must be below .03% to be legal. By this I mean the total THC content of the ENTIRE crop harvested (as per local legislation). You will likely find that even with a small proportion of plants with an expected max THC range above what the limit is, as long as the end product quantitatively can be proven to have a TOTAL less than .03% THC, it is a legal product.

I don't know what sort of white trash locker room you've been in, but none of the ones I have been in in my many years of inter mural sports as a kid had anyone suggesting it was ok to give a woman an Australian handshake by way of greeting. Again, I think you need to learn what consent means... Ps, Bill Clinton had consent from Monica, maybe not his wife. What he is factually guilty of is lying under oath which is not even close to rape.
Lol and it's probably illegal in Oregon.
Still think they need to stop lying about it being a sport

If you believe that's all trump did with a rape case set for the 14th, you're daft.
If Hillary drops out that leaves the Bern as the fallback nominee.
It's often your best option if you're innocent, yet there is no way they won't toss the book at you in trial unless you're beyond lucky. It's a risk most aren't terribly comfortable taking.
Exactly.
They usually suggest a plea, if it goes to trial you're gone for closer to max.

Right? Soooooo sick of people telling me I'm a Hillary supporter cause I dis Trump a lot. There are more than two people running...
Still haven't reached the 14th when Assange promised to release the coup de gras for Hillary, enough evidence to ensure her indictment (or so he claims). Trump also has a child rape case set for that day too, as I remember. We may yet have the first election where both major nominees eat a bag of dicks and are booted out of the race. *crosses fingers*

Please be sure to pass this info on to anyone you know with a with a loved one suffering from this crippling addiction. My curse with boarding school and my loathing for where I went is that it meant I missed this fad when it came to those I grew up with... 4/5 of my childhood friends that were affected are in the same place. I became interested in non-addictive ways (methadone has higher addictive potential than heroin+a worse detox) and suboxone merely delays the withdrawal. Ibogaine has notoriety because it breaks the addictive chain without the detox symptoms (ok, it shares some but as a side effect of ibogaine and vastly reduced from the expected opioid withdrawal. It has about a 50% success rate in the immediate (reduced in long term). The key to success (and I can't stress this enough)) is after care. A downside is the lingering depression after. From a friend's experience, what this wonder drug does is force the addict to face the terrible shit that caused them to seek solace from their drug of choice (DOC) in the first place. After facing what led them to choose DOC over sobriety, the come down seems to revisit the part of the person locked inside that was scared enough to hide from reality in the first place and again see the beauty they have lost touch with. It is again NOT a pleasant journey, which I find needs to be stressed to the person imbibing this life saving drug. This 100% ensues that they are committed enough to escaping hell to consider knowingly having a terrible trip with the goal to save themselves from self-destruction. If you know someone suffering from opioid addiction and desperate for change, I may or may not have suggestions on where to go to seek help. As an after note... 6 of 7 people I know who have tried this to get and stay clean from heroin are many years into sobriety now. Seriously, anyone you know that has a friend, loved one or themselves has issues with this horribly crippling addiction and seeks sobriety should be passed this info.

It is a class C felony actually... Though in this state that is apparently the equivalent of just meeting the fluffer on the porn set, enough to get one excited, but not see the job to the finish. Apparently in Oregon (literally from the mouth of a Sargent with the sheriff's office), unless you're a violent offender or have VERY grave charges against you (he literally mentioned two things that would actually see conviction), the DA won't see it through due to budget.

90% certain he's been spotted multiple times near EPUD on Seavey loop Rd in Eugene. Closest anyone has gotten, if you can zoom the picture you'll see the lighter patch between his eyes. The 10% uncertainty comes from the tall grass and zoom quality. If it isn't the grass, that is my sweet boy. As he has refused to come near anyone and is a 15 minute drive (assuming no police to pull me over) it's been impossible to get up there before a cat decides to mosey on... The culvert pictured goes under the road (and another nearby had a dead mole at the EPUD side entrance) goes under the road into state controlled land (with clear 'no trespassing' signs.

The first time we learned of this he was freaking out upstairs running around (par de norm for his crazy ass) and then came down the stairs yelping like a mofo, then ran out onto the porch still yelping. When we calmed him down his issue was evident...

What had happened was....
He consumed a tampon out of the garbage and when it came out it arrived cotton first at the end of his shouldn't have pooed inside, puppy mistake. He was freaking out because the rip cord you should never pull was still partially stuck inside with no poo backer to push it the rest of the way out...

Actually, as long as she was over 18 they had permission to enter the domicile, the girlfriend gave it to them. That very bit of permission, though she wasn't the lease holder/owner, is all they legally need to enter. There was no unconstitutional nature to this ruling. It is 100% by the book which isn't to say the book is right.
See how much bullshit and media propaganda this is with a fact check off the info seen here... As in look it up after to verify that this meme is 20000% incorrect

And like you have the right to complain about what YOU choose for YOUR body, that does NOT give you the right to make that choice for someone else because of a lack of consideration for historical context. The rules you're attempting to enforce on someone else's free will would make sense in a society that necessarily needed parents to have 9 kids to get 1-2 to adulthood and reproduction. Now, we are over populated and necessarily going to experience natures defense system in its full force. With our largest supply of food STILL having radioactive material leak into it from Fukushima on and aquatic life turning up dead because it ate too much garbage we're without a doubt going to experience famine, from there disease is just a step away. Good thing we're building a better environment for bacteria at the same time as we raise the temps. To summarize, those aborting aren't the problem, those remaining willfully ignorant of our true situation and pushing a blind following because of historical tradition (a logical fallacy I might add) are.

Ps, perhaps if he paid his federal taxes for the $362 million he declares as income you'd actually have a better aid program already in place, yet he chooses to get audited for not paying a penny into federal taxes every year directly giving those fighting for 'freedom' or needing federal aid a big fuck you.
Agreed
I don't like her, I'm just not crazy enough to think that Trump will do good by me. You should know better too. You realize that the federal aid programs you rely on, such as insurance, food stamps and your disability check will be directly affected by a Trump presidency. The question is, what's your plan for when he takes your federal aid away or reduces it considerably?
Bingo, illegals pay taxes fairly often making them a less of a burden by far.
Yeah, that's not quite how it works. A digital forensics person (which I assure you was used to investigate) can find even deleted items. They don't just vanish without a trace and can be recreated with digital forensics tools. Again I repeat, she was found to have not talked about sensitive information over the email.
You realize she has already been cleared of any criminal charges on that matter, correct? As in, it was investigated and not one of the emails actually gave any valuable information away.
You realize he got trounced in the debate right? Snorting whatever he took before the debate prolly not the best idea.

Congratulations on admitting that your promo was utilizing your friends, though I didn't see one with anyone who couldn't talk perfect American English in the limited bit they spoke. Still waiting on all this PhD level proof, of which I presume now you have none or you would've just laid that one me a long time ago rather than attempting to put up straw men and continue to deceive your would be clients on real expectations.
A response from the body indicating that absorption and the state shift is starting to occur is hardly saying the person feels the effects. In all the videos I've seen Jenny jumps in and pushes they feel it as the customer stammers and goes along with what they feel they are supposed to say. All the evidence they aren't feeling it is in your videos. Insisting that a single benign change in physiology that happens for thousands of reasons that aren't related to being affected by a drug is like saying because I can smoke 1000 cigs and not die, they aren't bad for me. It proves nothing. Then again as a scientist you're very aware and just relying on the ignorance of those seeing your videos. That and being able to call PhD and drop names while giving 0 definitive proof. I'm sure the longer you argue without giving any the stronger your position looks.
Partial absorption, with effects still minutes out. Which is why you must disrespect the individual requested to note when they feel it by thrusting upon them they are already high. For the same reason that smoking cannabis takes up to 10 minutes for full onset, sublingual is tied to that too. Again you've thrown no proof just tossed names at it.
A digestive tract would do at least as good a job as either.
Not 100% I'm not gonna do it no matter the outcome
I already found someone to sneak me into Canada.
Better have a lifeline in case he lies too much for your booze quantity
Clearly the guy filming leaves a lot to be desired of she's THAT lonely.
I'll keep her company any time of night 😈
Then show me your PhD level proof instead of merely acting like 14 years of experience working with extracts, tinctures and many other forms of experiencing this plant is nothing. Yet you have given no proof short of video's that are clearly leading the person with your expectation and 0 proof. All experience reports for the past 60+ years show that sublingual is quick, but not seconds quick. You can continue to deflect and not show proof that your product which I have called you out for falsely advertising actually works as such. So let's see your evidence. Second's would be true with an injection, submucosal being as close to injection as one can get is also quick, with the problem of the barrier into the blood stream and capillary absorption rate. But please, continue to talk down to me while avoiding any actual proof expecting an uneducated individual on the other end.
^^ nice switch if account. Trying to appear as if a client is chiming in? here I am calling YOU out on the fact that mere seconds is not long enough for the body to metabolize your product (thereby putting the burden of proof that your product actually does this). And I have been conducting lots of studies on cannabis for 14 years . I assure you, I have been very through in my marijuana research and methods of delivery.
Yet ask for the customers input on when it is felt and what is felt without the respect for the individual to allow them to answer the question, plus falsifying the time frame it takes effect. Sublingual is quick, yes. What it is not is instantaneous, it'll take a few minutes to be fully absorbed and in your system in the first place.

Wonderful deflection, but as you made your snopes comment right after my reply, it's kinda a direct initiation of debate.
Why? Because you don't care if you're passing on false information and therefore contributing to the dumbing down of America?

No, they took it as prescribed but go ahead and keep playing the straw man tactic, I'm sure that's a really solid argument tactic.
I know just as many people that have died because of that as heroin. It was an epidemic freshman year of college. Are you aware of methadone's history?
I missed the heroin fad back home, but I've seen the aftermath of this 'cure' in the one friend that survived. Everytime she quits her suboxone, she relapsed because of the delayed withdrawal she experienced.
All suboxone does is delay the withdrawal experience so an opioids addict doesn't have to face that part. Months or years after quitting, they will STILL experience the delayed withdrawal if they quit taking their wafer. That is called a transferal of addiction.

Right, but see you get to choose what you do with YOUR body in a free country, not put limitations on the choices someone else makes for their own body. To do so would again mean the back alley abortion days and the deaths of thousands of desperate women on the hands of those egotistical enough to think their choice mattered more than someone else's.
It is pretty shite, I agree

The reality is, the damage is already done. What we are looking at is how best to slow the end date so we can solve the problem before it's too late.
I'm done buying into the lie that I only have two choices. If I'm voting for someone I do not believe in, I am merely throwing my vote away. As long as I'm doing that anyways, it might as well be for the one I believe will actually serve me.
I still AM.
Sadly the reality is, we probably won't survive even if we stopped abusing the environment today. Within the next 15 years the temp will have risen to a permanent +6°f, all ice caps and glaciers will be gone, much of the land mass we know today will be sunk, all Arctic species will be wiped out and one of our major food sources will be pretty wrecked (the ocean from Fukushima, still leaking). Now I'm no expert, but that sounds like famine will set in really quickly, followed quickly by disease. We are in a self caused age of mass extinction, start stocking up on first aid supplies and canned goods, even bullets. And for the love of the gods, get your bug out bag and plan ready.

The false patriotism comes from the people forgetting that this country was founded by rebellious people who were not willing to be extorted by the English crown in the form of centralized banking (which kept us in permanent debt to the crown with no way to pay it off without taking a larger loan). Nothing is more patriotic that questioning tyranny and rebelling against it, proof is our 10th amendment right, which grants us the right to fight tyrannical threats to our way of life.

Dan, it would help if the official story were possible by the laws of physics, but the towers fell at free fall speed, aka there was 0 resistance on the way down. Plus with the official theory, all windows of all surrounding buildings facing the tower would have broken due to the pressure of one floor falling into the next thereby closing the void under extreme pressure. The pressure of course generating an increasingly explosive action as the void gets crushed. Boil water in an enclosed glass container. When the pressure builds, it releases outward, not inward (which indicates IMplosion).

Also that when billions of dollars stand to be made by the two families involved as a result, that equates to more than enough motive to make an easy trial. In other words since a majority of the company producing our weapons of war is owned by the Bush family and the Bin Laden family, they would legally be considered guilty by the US judicial system if it ever came to trial.
But we'll quickly forget that the day before the pentagon lost near $7trillion, the air force lost its 100% success in grounding hijacked planes and loads of laws of physics all mysteriously stopped working simultaneously and not ask any questions about why the impossible was possible for a 3-4 hour period.

It also would take generations to take effect
Alcoholics who illegally adopted a child tend to be that way
I will agree with this, though the person that said it isn't aware of the reasons why it could be true. He COULD do something like an executive order to ensure that the educational budget went to low income neighborhoods (where the parents can't donate to improve the school for their child) instead of the rich areas (where the parents can and should give to help the system succeed). In this day and age a lack of education means a lack of a job and basic survivalist instinct means any human will do whatever the Fuck it takes to survive. That being said an uneducated person that ain't getting a job yet needs ~20k/year to survive will result to whatever it takes. Now the system I proposed clearly won't JUST effect the black population, but we can see by the 'crime rate' exactly who suffers most from lack of education and the desperation that comes necessarily from that.

Right, but that is from a meat farm, not an egg farm. My point is there is literally no correlation between those two practices. Why? Because and egg farmer wants eggs, not babies. Therefore the hens will never see a rooster.
In other words, you are not killing a damned thing, there is nothing growing inside the egg
You realize that chickens lay eggs regardless of if they are fertilized or not. If they aren't fertilized the chicken walks away from it as if it is merely a different kind of poop right?

Pps... We have had the technology to 100% end our dependence on fossil fuels for a long time. Proof is the bullet train Japan, which is only limited to ~200mph due to wind resistance.

^^burn. Ida, the reality of this planet's environmental affairs because of the greed and lack of accountability allowed by Uncle Sam is quite drastic. We are currently in an age of mass extinction, overpopulated and not even scratching the surface of slowing the damage we are causing. In the next 15 years we will see the die off of ALL Arctic species, likely a bunch of marine die off, as well now. You realize that nature's got a really good system to keep its balance, disease and famine. As the glaciers and ice caps rapidly vanish (again 15 years) the planet will get warmer, thereby creating a better environment for disease and bacterias. Now it may not (read likely won't be) be us that the bacteria effects, however expect the food supply to get mighty low and be very prepared to go vegan, assuming we don't allow our government to spray for mosquitoes and kill off the bees like they have done in the Carolinas. As a final note, blindly following what you are told is far from patriotic. If our founding fathers had believed as you do we'd still be under English control. When the flag looks out for 1% of the population, creates fantastic stories of false enemies to propel us into a war for the very resource that has destroyed the planet, it becomes time to act. If my generation allows blind fools like you to continue to pave our way we will not survive to see our children grow up.

Rick Straussman is a personal hero of mine, I have done many a research paper on his work.

https://www.rickstrassman.com
https://www.rickstrassman.com/
Synthetic dmt is rare namely because it is a complicated synthesis that requires not only specialized (and expensive) lab equipment, but training to use said equipment (also expensive). What one finds is organic in origin and unaltered as such. That being said, the quality of the chemist is always up to question. As the extraction is a very basic one that merely relies on making the alkaloid solvable, there isn't very much dangerous left. On the dangerous scale, it's more dangerous to walk across the street.
You are born experiencing the effects of this brain chemical and will experience it again when you die (hence the man reports of white light, meeting god, etc.)
No, it will simply get metabolized into serotonin (the chemical responsible for happiness) and melatonin (the chemical in turkey that creates the after thanksgiving feast nap effect).
Dmt is a naturally occurring brain chemical that metabolizes into serotonin and melatonin. I doubt brain damage is possible.

Because it would come from a university or a college and is not part of the program taught at the academy.
That would take as long as a normal degree program from an accreted collage.

Not saying that. Saying honor your ancestor's bravery and sacrifice that brought you a better life. As is I feel like the ancestor that went through that is still looked down on in a sense. That person went through some serious shit to ensure that his family has a chance to fight the racism and bigotry deep inside the system so bent on bringing it to the world as we crash it around ourselves.
No, but I am implying that through the suffering of their ancestors that got sold from local tribesman into slavery that life for the modern defendants is far better than what it could be in Africa. Was it right? No, absolutely not. However the bare facts do still stand, life is better here than in a war town third world country.

Colorado has the only legal law that is sensible and allows small businesses to flourish rather than the same large corporations making more money at your expense.
Y'all should consider what's happened in Washington and Oregon before voting yes. In Washingnton, legitimate medical businesses got shut down because in making the law on legality they made a lot of technical issue that spanned both sides. Issue enough thousands of businesses closed. In Oregon it went to the liquor board, now the only extract that is legal without paying $4000 on a license on top of the 2-20000k for an extraction machine and 3-4K for a static free environment. In other words, I would be a felonious criminal for using the ~$2500 in extraction equipment I purchased, with 15 years of experience extracting via my method, without spending another 6k+. Think about who benefits, it will NOT be you.
This is the election I gave up on throwing my vote away to some giant douche or shit sandwich. I will be too
Holy yum

Group: Miraculous Healing: Activate Cosmic Consciousness
Thanks.
Cest la vie. It was fun while it lasted
That's because rapist or criminals with money very rarely see the full time.
Basically after making an ~$2500 business purchase I am a felon to use it without spending at least $6k more. I might also add, I live in Oregon. My business went from legal to felonious and closed because of it months after legal sales hit the state.
Jordan quite simply because they gave it to the very corporations we were fighting against. Washington closed hundreds if not thousands of legal businesses to make the cultivation and sales too complicated and expensive for the little guy. Then again, businesses were closed so that shift could happen. In Oregon the liquor board got the law, now extracts that use a solvent other than alcohol are illegal unless that extract artist spends not only over 2k on the extractor, but 4K on a license and likely 3k on above the top safety requirements. Butane must be at a 60/40 ratio to Oxygen to become flammable, in other words every time you hear of someone blowing themselves up making BHO, they are only probing Darwin right. One would literally be high enough from fume inhalation to think lighting a joint is a good idea. These are the weakest links, simple as that.
Perhaps you don't understand the real statistics behind the drug war and why with only 5% of the world's population, the US has 25% of the prison population. Here you see from a government site that almost 50% of the prison population is in for a drug related offense while only about 25% are in for a crime directly linked to a victim other than themselves.

I'm going to say as one that's personally witnessed several therapeutic rounds of ibogaine for heroin addiction, it is not pleasant. In fact from the several quests for self I've witnessed it seems to force the user into facing the darkness they ran from to start their addiction in the first place. The very tail end is when the inner light reveals itself again, otherwise it's an extended stay in the thick of your shit. I would suggest that mushrooms or dmt would be better if your intended goal is to fight feelings of being down. Here you can see a serotonin molecule (your body's happy chemical) next to psilocin (what psilocybin breaks down into that makes you trip) and dmt (Alex grey's art is inspired by this one). What you see is that it requires very little for your body to metabolize either of the two psychedelics into the happy chemical. This is why mushrooms are currently being used in clinical studies to treat depression as well as anti-smoking.

Not surprising. The douchebag I dealt with in Olympia still hasn't had any judgement on the 9 counts of sexual assault, 7 with a minor that came out after I got the piece of shit on the news for 12 counts animal cruelty. The cops ignored my ex's case that merely needed them to run a drug test for the drug he point blank asked if we had heard of and then wrote off as a woman's vitamin. She was drugged and separated fro three weeks, you can imagine. In the time the police SHOULD have been after this violent offender, they shot an unarmed man instead. He will likely walk for all of it.

Research or no, it is their choice to apply for the position to be objectified. Don't be jealous because they have less body shame and make more money because of it.
but it an industry based on tips. If the clients desire to toss the entirety of their hard earned check on a woman he/she/they like to watch dance seductively then why is it a problem. Most of the dancers I know see it as rather empowering to take an entire paycheck without having to do more than give a peek at what they were born with.
I'm just gonna say, we have be and still are in an age of extinction due to our choice to ignore the mounting consequences of our environmental impact in the past 250 years. We have been actively taking part in the world ending, only the bible or other such fables indicates that it will be instant Armageddon for us. Hold on tight, cause we're going to go for a rough ride over the next 14 years to having permanently shifted the earth's temp by a +6, ensuring we have no glaciers or polar ice caps left. Just saying, we already are doing it.
Asshat

Of course it does, have lots of money, don't do the time.
Oh my
Seriously, I think it's time we got past silly superstitions and looked at the facts. Mother Earth, who we widely accept as being alive, factually gives us everything the bible says 'god' does. The problem is, she is tangible, and not in the sky. So instead of recognizing that we are destroying ourselves by killing what the bible defined as 'god,' we fight over which imaginary peeping tom in the clouds is real. Time for some serious change. Religion is an outdated system where modern people are taking advice on modern living from a primitive culture that had no understanding on a majority of how life works.
I mean, white people going in to Compton is a really bad thing. I can think of neighborhoods in Atlanta that the same applies, such as the spot where my friend was found shot with nothing stolen. I agree this pushes those limits, but going to a new city, it may not be a bad thing to know where the neighborhoods to avoid for safety are. That goes for white, black, red or yellow however.

The answer is we were in 2012 and still are today. Nature isn't typically instant, though there are several world ending possibilities she can summon forth. We are currently in an age of extinction, as we allow our governments to continue to lie to us about the state of affairs of the environment, ignore the tech that could end our reliance on fossil fuels years ago, and fight stupid wars while dividing us by as many lines as possible then we are likely to be among the species that gets lost to this age.

Jason that just cause your local reps are lying to you via the mass media. If they state funded the obamacare it wouldn't be put on the people forced to buy insurance. My insurance policy is great and cheap, because my local reps don't make me take it in the pooper.

True that if more people took the hard road and went rural the environment would be better, but imagine the ridiculous sprawl with one city spreading out like that... Our society has gone one way with it, sadly it's not a sensible path.
Right, but many people have a hard time finding sustainable work in rural areas. A drive into the city for work is a nightmare of hellish proportions.

I'm just gonna say, back in Atlanta a crappy apartment costs at least 1k, before power, water, sewer and garbage (unless garbage is included). And I've paid that for a third of a shittier apartment in Boston. Just sayin local prices are pretty good in comparison to what I've seen in my wanderlust.

Mining is deff a cool venture to undertake with friends, I don't argue that in the least. I would suggest Jim Coleman mines near Hot Springs for that venture. You'll have a lot more success going for the Quartz than digging through the waste of a diamond mine. Yes, at Coleman you'll be digging through their waste too, Quartz gets less of a price so you can still find some amazing pieces. Here are a few more ideas (including the diamond mine again).

And dude, if they suspect he's on it and there's a test for it (they can find metabolites of any drug), they woulda run the test.
No theory behind it... He was not on bath salts as per the toxicology report.
I suppose learning how to count cards might be easier
Idk, I've found that letting go of that thinking has opened my world to many amazing experiences, place, people and adventures.
Dude stands no chance, he's on Clinton payroll to look like a retard and make everyone rush to vote her criminal ass in. It's a shit show man.

I'm just going to go out on a limb and suggest he didn't actually have that drug in his system. The last 'zombie' in Fl tested positive for cannabis, NOT bath salts. To assume very specific toxicology reports having 0 information is like playing roulette, sure you might be right, but the reason the payout is high is cause the odds blow (you also get paid out lower than the odds are, further tipping the scales against you).

This being the same type of fear mongering propaganda that has given rise to our enemies who finance their operations by sales of herion and othe black market stuff.
Yeah I know it was the other one. The point is they made a huge stink about it being bath salts the first time, then failed to publicly renounce the lie after the tox results just came back with weed in his system. Judging by previous lack of transparency my comments are more than valid. Assuming that THIS one actually has anything in his system PRIOR to tox screen results is misinformation and therefore fear mongering propaganda.
Very, but that doesn't make me think either of the main candidates should be... This is the election I stop voting for the lesser of two evils and start voting for who I actually like (hint, it's rarely either of the two main)
Holy cool
They also found no human flesh in his stomach (weird for someone eating a face off).
From the wiki page, note the highlighted area... 'Toxicology reports were only able to identify cannabis/marijuana in Eugene's system, leaving the ultimate cause of his behavior unknown.[4]'
It sure as hell wasn't bath salts with the last face eater (who was also still moving after taking like 18 bullets). My guess is the cry of 'flakka' is also bullshit to try to legislate against yet another chemical.

Tina, most of the ritualistic shamanic sacraments contain the necessity of purging (vomit etc), or physical discomfort to be granted access to the great mystery and be gifted knowledge, powers of healing, or clairvoyance. It's part of the process.

Their law is a major success while this far the rest of the legalization laws have handed the production directly over to the major corporations that have been lobbying against it for years. Ensure the law follows colorado's BEFORE you vote for it, otherwise small businesses will be closed (which has happened in Oregon and Washington) rather than nurtured and allowed to expand in the market they already serve.

I bought a bb gun that looked much like my .45 and tucked it in my waistband with my shirt tucked into it. I walked my ass right past his boy and close enough to the guy to be able to utilize self defense tactics while his boy was signing to him. I bought no bb's, nor co2, yet still took advantage of the situation by only giving them a partial glance. 😈

Thus far all a vote of legalization has done is hand cannabis directly over to the industries that fought so very hard against it for so long. Liquor board had cannabis in Oregon, now only liquor extracts are legal without at least $6-10k to invest in facilities and licenses. In Washington they shut down countless legitimate businesses to implement a practice so complicated you have to be able to hire a mess of employee's to keep up with the vigorous tracking. The only vote worth a damn is medical.

"The odds of being murdered using a firearm in the US in a given year are about 30,000 to 1. If you aren't engaged in some sort of criminal enterprise, and don't live in a violent domestic situation, your odds are much, much lower, around 150,000 to one."
But that includes most cops.
What time at home?
But parents are taught that education is someone else's responsibility. Plus many have to work till they drop to support the house.
It's easy to find lies, harder to research the truth. Also, religion is to blame. Historically speaking it made sense (9 kids needed to get 1-2 to adulthood). Now it's asinine to take advice from a primitive society that has nothing in common with how the modern world works. Religion is beautiful, but like Asop's fables. It is a set of stories, written to be culturally relevant (characters, situations, etc) meant to teach a moral, love.
Because of the Internet..
Lol, good times

Lol, this shit just makes me giggle at the school system. This is proof that though the citizens COULD all receive a great education, they do not come close to it.
Two of my 10 portions, with the remaining thick hunk of beef
Right? The other options are unhealthy, unbalanced, carb and sugar heavy shite. Plus I literally just snagged a 4lb hunk of steak that cut down to 10 meal sized portions for $13 and have gotten lobster tail for $2 locally... If shopping is done smart, amazing deals can be found on bout anything.
Frankly, the very minute they try they will have proven that we are not only the nation behind the largest genocide in human history, but we also have borrowed Hitler's tactics that allowed him to rise to the position of power he did.

It is our second amendment duty to protect this nation from ANY source of tyranny, domestic or foreign.

See the picture of my giant steak for proof you're wrong depending on location.
Cut it yourself and it's cheaper ;)
Right, $20 and you'll get 8-10 steaks.
$13, 4lb steak... It cut down to 10 portioned steaks..
Bottom line is we made ISIS.
Or would've droned them as they crossed a barren 200 mile stretch of desert BEFORE they had the capability of defending against such an attack.
And if we had really wanted to stop them we wouldn't have made an arms deal with them and then just left our military bases abandoned with all the weapons still there.
The other alternatives are food like substitutes and are not good for people. Why condemn someone to being unhealthy simply because they are part of the population that must have not so the 1% can exist.
I'm just going to say, in this state you can find 4lbs of steak for $13... It cut down to 10 steaks or a little over $1/steak... Tell me how that is bad for someone on food stamps.
Lol dig it
Also WOOT WOOT
Haha, see you before long then :p
Let me explain odds to you here... Infinite number of galaxies, solar systems etc in an ever expanding universe means that the bet that there is alien life out there has an INFINITE number of chances of being right. Those of us that may place a wager or two would suggest that an unending chance of winning is what is known as a 'sure fire bet.' Placing ACTUAL bets have way worse odds, placing a bet with someone who knows odds and how to stack them will suck you dry before you know what hit you. Go to a carnival and play any of the games night before they leave town if you don't believe me. Take every bet they offer you and tell them to thank me for sending you. 😈😈

To have to undergo a surgical opening of the vagina to alleviate a serious urinary issue because of the vaginal closing means the two holes are VERY close together, close enough that sealing the vagina becomes factually dangerous as a result. I fail to see any argument that will trump an article published by the 'national center of biotechnology info,' proving that closing the vagina can also close the urethra too. Ps... Sleep well.
Which thus PROVES that the two openings are close enough that my theory of it becoming difficult to impossible to urinate once that hole is closed is valid. #yatzy
Scholarly source backing my claim that 'difficulty in voiding' (polite way of saying she had a hard time taking a pee) can occur from vaginal closing.
'METHODS: A 16-year-old adolescent was referred for obliterated vagina and urinary retention. She had recurrent urinary tract infections, difficulty in voiding, and cyclic hematuria. At the age of 1 year she had been taken by her mother to a pediatric surgeon to have a Type I FGM procedure. On examination, the urethral meatus and vaginal orifices were completely closed by the FGM scar. She underwent uneventful surgical opening of the vagina.'

^^ I'm just going to say that as a studied tantric, I am aware and consistently hit multiple pleasure zones I bet you didn't know you had. The G-spot is obvious, but the A spot and U spot are different beasts and aren't used to their full potential.
"The U-Spot. This is a small patch of sensitive erectile tissue located just above and on either side of the urethral opening. It is absent just below the urethra, in the small area between the urethra and the vagina. Less well known than the clitoris, its erotic potential was only recently investigated by American clinical research workers. They found that if this region was gently caressed, with the finger, the tongue, or the tip of the penis, there was an unexpectedly powerful erotic response.

While on the subject of the female urethra, it is important to mention ‘female ejaculation.’ In the male, the urethral tube delivers both urine and seminal fluid containing sperm. In the female it is usually believed that it delivers only urine, but this is not the case. When there is an unusually powerful orgasm, some females may emit a liquid from their urethral openings that is not urine. There are specialized glands surrounding the urethral tube, called Skene’s glands, or para-urethral glands, similar to the male’s prostate, and under extreme stimulation they produce an alkaline liquid that is chemically similar to male seminal fluid. Women who experience ejaculation (which ranges in quantity from a few drops to a few tablespoonfuls), sometimes imagine that the extreme muscular exertions of their climactic moments have forced them into involuntary urination, but this is simply because they do not understand their own physiology. Nor, incidentally, did some medical authorities, who insisted that ejaculating women were suffering from ‘urinary stress incontinence’ and suggested operations to cure it. (One man recently sued for divorce because he believed that his wife was urinating on him, such is the ignorance of female genital activity.)"
Yet you cannot even see your own vagina without awkward acrobatics...
Think kidney stone
Tammy, clearly I have looked at a LOT more vaginas close up than you. The U spot, or urethra is separated from the penetration spot by like 1mm. Any stitch would pull it irrevocably tighter making it again difficult if not impossible to pee.
Tammy the point is that the hole for penetration being stitched fully would also stitch over the urethra making it VERY difficult, if not impossible to pee... So YES, they may be two separate holes, however the proximity of the openings and the labia running from clit to taint would close the hole. How do I know more about female anatomy than a female??
Reiki and ho'oponopono prayers heading her way.
Yes, but would make peeing very difficult, if not impossible if totally sewed up.
How cool
yes but is literally at the top of the other opening meaning that if it is stitched fully closed...

How are Trump's racist comments and supporters my responsibility? Wonderful use of a straw man defense, however that defense relies entirely on the straw man being a somewhat sound argument. Blaming their racism on liberals is ridiculous. I endorse NEITHER of the main two politicians, one's a racist idiot who doesn't have time for things like facts and the other is a criminal and morally bankrupt. The only reason she's still in the running is she has dirt on most of capital hill.

Man, I had a video to reply to his publicist but he took down the two tweets in the article and made Trump post something to that effect then retweeted it.
It's easier to say get a fire going and burry it for a week or two, uncover it and you have coal. Mining of coal is dangerous work, involving lots of noxious chemicals and explosives. Having been to a coal mining town, they already aren't working and haven't been since the early 1900's. This video has little to do with matters of import. Like 10 people will loose their jobs (exaggerated number).
You do realize we do not have to mine coal, right?
We're all once race, homosapian. The difference is merely cultural based and location base of heritage (how much sun over thousands of years). It's still pretty new as a term used for division by skin color, having only started to be used as such in the 19th century. Frankly, I see it as more of a way to fracture the people than anything productive and yes, I support love. Gay, straight, mixed skin tone.
You get me... That shower rod would probably do some serious damage if used in a stabbing motion (assuming the rubber stopper came off) 😈
Read the constitution and look for the same words Trump is supposed to.
I guess you may need to take his advise too. He is pointing out that trump's entire campaign runs on the misguided principle that brown people are not equal citizens because of the color of their skin.

The very fact that you felt the need to mention the color of the population's skin as if it was relevant proves you complete misunderstanding of the term racist. You are indeed showing your prejudice, which is only made more clear by your reaction to being called out on it devolving in to a third grade vocabulary. It's cool man, we all judge you for your comments just as much as you clearly judge others who have a darker complexion than yourself.
At the time I was on the track for a chemistry Phd with a goal to be working in alternate energy research and attempting to fix the environmental problems we have let get way out of hand... Clearly I'm not currently in a lab, nor on that track anymore. My deepest thanks to the just-us system for the wrongful imprisonment.
I consider myself lucky after going to prison for a DUI 0.00 (yup literally blew a 0.00 and still got arrested). Currently living in Oregon, you can imagine what the blood and urine they forcibly took had in my system, the medicine cannabis sativa from two days prior. I get a prescription for it now. Either way, 10k fine, 4 month in prison (down from 2.5 years only because I 'cried' pleasing how sorry I was to be so horribly DUI), 5 years probation and the requirement to give my car a blowjob for a year after the 6 I had to wait to get my license back. The reality is, after you get out you can get a shit job that barely pays, or you can do the same shit (or worse) that landed you in prison in the first place. If it was meant to help ANYONE I wouldn't consider myself INCREDIBLY lucky to have all that shit behind me.

Bingo, gloves give lazy employees an easy way to avoid proper sanitation.
The precautions we take mean that most employees change their gloves less than they would wash their hands touching the same stuff lol.
And do you change them every time you step away to do anything else? Every time you reach in the fridge, etc.
In other words, many food service employees put on their gloves and only take em off for breaks thinking that cross contamination doesn't exist. Just sayin.
It goes in the oven, with proper sanitation gloves are irrelevant and if you saw how gloves were commonly used, you'd appreciate their lack of gloves. ;)

Saw a squid sausage recipe and decided that the squid would make a great tube for other stuffings, I was right. Ps, the pets loved all the parts of the squid I was gonna toss out.
Get a whole squid from an Asian grocery store (frozen section) and clean it (head comes off inneards come out and there is a bit of cartilage to pull out, then rinse the tube throughly. Chop the tentacles off the head and dice, mix with mushrooms and cheese, and stuff back inside the tube (it shrinks a lot so don't stuff full, 3/4 full seemed good. Lightly brown on both sides (in this case it turns purple, not brown), cover tightly and bake for 25 minutes.

It would've been nice if she had gone whistle blower, however and shared the reality that the Taliban AND ISIS were both trained and armed by the CIA and indeed get their Israeli intelligence paycheck (which is funded by the CIA). Then again, what she DID share in no way out her in danger of violating her serious contract to silence and only made the CIA look like its hand wasn't there in the first place.

You realize that the paper trail to the start on the 'war on terror' leads back to the two families involved owning a majority of the company that produced all our weapons of war right? To top it all off, every Texas oil company W. Bush tanked was funded by Bin Laden money. The CIA even trained him and all of his Taliban as Israeli intelligence...
Edit reply: tell me you think you can sneak an ar15 past a doorman, along with that much ammo?

You'll note that classes and proof of competence is part of that requirement. In other words, he has to prove he can hit his target with a very high percentage of accuracy and has likely undergone courses and trainings to prove that he can distinguish between threat and non threat in the heat of the moment.

Just saying, without him the poppy fields might not have generated as much income to an illicit organization, preventing them from ever being a valid threat.

Ummm, because they have been protected, they haven't been cut down allowing them to grow as nature intended as the southern most point of the only old growth forest in Amerika. Had what happened to the east coast (which used to be 100% old growth forest) been allowed there, it would've been annihilated). Old growth means that forest is 1000's of years old, the pacific north west has the last remaining old growth. If you'd like proof I can supply a map and links to support my statement.

^^exactly we have the black market where US military weapons are sold daily and by the thousands, if not millions will still be open and have more income. With all likelihood, the fl shooter did not buy his gun legally, most certainly the Ca shooting was ALL black market supplies. Not only will they get the weapons with ease, the black market is currently what is funding our enemies (mostly through heroine production, which was on the decline till the US showed up). In reality, this war is because the poppy fields were failing AND they wanted oil. The US funds it's illegal wars by allowing drugs to enter the country and then extorting the citizens by charging $450k/year for every person behind bars. If you've ever seen the inside of a jail or prison you're very aware that nowhere near that amount gets spent, the rest goes to black budget and shenanigans I'm betting you don't agree with. In other words, the black market also funds what's wrong locally. Matt is 200% correct, it's a failed system. Teach gun safety to kids in High School, teach them respect early on, see how many people are around to stop this shit after.
Excuse me, but if the media is to be believed it's happens twice now and Russia is a power definitely big enough to land on our shores. Our imaginary 'terrorists' only land attacks fronted by the FEDS. Look up the original twin tower bombing. Criminals will ALWAYS have access to these guns, I'd rather have something comparable should they come into my neighborhood. I assure you, if you were my neighbor when shit went down, you'd thank me profusely for not being a coward like you.
That's not the only issue, CHP is most certainly not their names, they are falsely identified and therefore can commit crimes rather easily with much more difficulty to identify the perpetrator.
Thy also are not properly identified with name an badge number. Also Doug is right, desecration of the flag
And what do you think will be required if terrorists, Russia or any one of our new enemies lands soldiers on our soil? Those of us with the guts to defend our communities and families stepping up to do just that, hunt people. This is why they are legal, because in a time of extreme crisis our country need not be lost should the military fail.
Looks crazy
An assault rifle is only dangerous in the hands of a sociopath, in the hands of a law abiding citizen it is protection should shit really hit the fan.
Which are useless if we actually do have to form militia to defend ourselves. Plus it won't matter what the law is, criminals will just have a bolstered black market, a market that is used to FUND said terrorists. The answer is simple, remove the need for a black market and our 'terrorist' enemies have no funding. #warWon
This is what a ninja looks like
And let's face it, if a responsible gun owner with a concealed carry permit had been at that club, less death would've occurred. Why don't schools employ at least one or two ex-military with concealed carry that the kids never know about. Imagine the news then, 'tragedy adverted by well treated war hero.'
The very minute they take our weapons we have fulfilled the last of the many failures by the German people that lead to the Nazi's. If you don't believe me, reach in your pocket and pull out your propaganda instantly to millions device and Google search Hitler's propaganda films. He at least had to send vans riding around to spread the lies. Next step was to take their weapons, then turn the weapons on the people and say conform to what I say or die. History is trying to repeat itself, don't fall into the propaganda cycle.
Ummm, I support our easy access to firearms and I most certainly won't preach Muslim hate. I stand by our second amendment right which gives us the right to protect ourselves from ANY tyrannical threat, domestic or foreign. Boys in blue take 30+ minutes to arrive to 'protect' you, smith and Wesson delivers in under 1 second. Criminals and sociopath's will ALWAYS have easy access to guns, why penalize those of us that if we had been present and practicing open carry would've put a quick an less tragic stop to the situation?
Lol, jackass
Aka, proving his point
I mean you can ague, but it only proves your an idiot that is speaking out of ignorance
Don't believe all the hype, ISIS has and always will be a US government front and they are avidly trying to take away our right to defend ourselves against ANY tyrannical threat to our freedoms. Let's face it, had a responsible gun owner been practicing open carry (or concealed on the bouncer) the entire night would've gone differently. Trust the boys in blue with their 30+ minute response time or a smith and Wesson with a .001 second response time?

They don't eat humans, their prey is much smaller so their mouth fits easier around it. They also do not have those big clunky fangs that are so easy to snap off with a jerking animal. It's actually a stronger adaptation for hunting and survival, we're just larger than their prey making it less effective (however still VERY possible). His finger in the mouth could've gone VERY poorly
We all agree that those MAKING the laws are corrupt, necessarily that means that those that willingly choose to enforce corrupt laws are ALSO corrupt. There is no such thing as a 'good cop.' Either by turning a blind eye to their 'brother's and sister's' in blue violating the law, or by the very nature of corrupt laws being forcefully enforced to literally rob the citizens at gun point, not one escapes this reality.
I disagree, she is a colored child. I've see cops sit a jimmy johns bike delivery guy down in cuffs across the street from his work while they illegally searched him for over an hour simply for riding his bike fast for his job. I worked next door and witnessed the entire thing. Just because you have the white privilege to not get assaulted because you're riding your bike, doesn't mean everyone does.
Funny story. This morning I woke up to a call from the caretaker at the abandoned mill across the way about a black chicken running around over there. So I hop out of bed and race across the street thinking one of my birds escaped. Show up to find a strange chicken, very scared and all alone. Fast forward an hour later when I have finally caught the damned thing (like I said she was/is scared). Had to chase it till it decided to try to hide it out cause it was tired to even manage to get closer than 20' from her. Finally she wore out and tried to hunker down in some tall grass. It would've worked if her butt wasn't huge, black and sticking out of the tuft of grass. Moral of the story is, I now have 23 hens and may get eggs from one this week.
Idk if you know this, but when you get your drivers license, you are asked about permission. It's called being an organ donor. #facepalm
they are rear fanged snakes, that means it doesn't have those massive beasties at the front of its mouth, rather smaller ones in the very back of the mouth.
Enough venom to kill 15 grown men with one bite. They are however rear fanged which makes it tough for them to inject venom into a human.

I've spent time in all legal states but Alaska since the vote went through. Colorado is the only one that got sensical legislation and the only state that actually WON by voting legal. Again, I haven't been to Alaska to see how their law develops yet.
I say Colorado simply because the lobbiests weren't ready for it and so the law went the way it should have, giving us little guys a chance at a new industry.
Washington is worse. Olympia Walmart knew over a year ago that they're store had already been cleared by corporate to have a cannabis expansion. As in Walmart will grow and sell cannabis, grow equipment, etc.
Until we figure out how to keep it out of the hands of the very corporations that lobbied against it, it's a bad move.

Nice. This one was long abused before I got here. I fixed it for years to come with more nutrients and microbes than it knows what to do with. Yay organics
The garden started utilizing Necter for the God's organic nutrient line, but we have moved away from that and towards making our own compost teas (usually mixed with kelp, compost and guano, then left to acquire microbial life for 24+ hours) and our own ferments. Basically the additives rebuilt the biodiversity that the soil around the rise was lacking while adding tons of nutrients for the microbe life to attack

They like the easy food and don't seem to want to go very far from it. If they can't see where it is at all times, it's simply because they are rooting around in the tall grass for bugs and can't see over it and are also less than 5' away lol.

Walmart in Olympia Washington literally is expanding to sell cannabis grow equipment etc. etc.
It literally wasn't until then that they stopped squabbling amongst themselves and tried to band together.
The idiots in Washington just sat by and watched it happen. The first sign I saw any sort of cooperation to try and stop it from being handed to Corporations
At least Oregon put up a good fight
Haven't looked at Alaska's law, but if the ones I've seen, Colorado is the only one that got it right and left it with the people. They simply didn't have the lobbiest's ready for it. They certainly do now.

Pictured we have molecules of serotonin, psilocin and DMT, note the structural similarities. Both serotonin and psilocin have only a few atomic differences from a dmt molecule, in the case of mushrooms, merely one hydroxide group's difference (which it what allows it to be an orally active form of DMT). Dmt is made in the pineal gland and metabolized into serotonin OR melatonin and is found in every living thing on the planet. That being said, adding DMT (or the orally active version psilocin) to our body chemistry means the enzyme Monoamine Oxidase will metabolize it into serotonin and melatonin, adding a larger reserve of the happy chemical to your body's chemistry. Not only COULD this work, it MUST work by the very basic chemistry. There IS no argument against it other than take our poison. *drops mic*

Hence the 'research' in the name. Ironically mr fl zombie did NOT have anything but THC in his system, it was just a nationwide propaganda push to legislate something similar to meth.
Bath salts does indeed relate to many such chemicals, all of which classify as 'research chemicals.' Research chemicals just means it's an analogue meant to have an interaction SIMILAR to a real drug, yet remain legal due to technicalities (though the minute it's sold for consumption legality is gone). That being said, all of these chemicals can easily be ordered from China online.
Yeah, just checked it, bath salts are in the cathinone family and are more closely related to mdma than anything in the 2c family (25I, 25t, 2ci, 2ct7, etc).
I don't think you're correct about 25I being bath salts, it is an LSD analogue, bath salts are a synthetic meth. However the rest of the comment is dead on.

mmmmkay... So, our brains are basically an on board super computer. That being said, that means it operates on a quantum level. in a conversation while the perception is that your killer reply came up as the first thought, it did not. In the mere second that it took you to reply, your brain analyzed many responses and fired that one to you as the best option. In other words, your brain works outside of time. Time being a human concept and a limitation that we have given ourselves and our brain already time stepping (ever ducked before you knew there was something about to hit you, or otherwise reacted seconds before something happened?). That being said, your memories are something unique, you are indeed time traveling and indeed existing in two places at one time. Anyone else ready to dab out and spend the afternoon time traveling??

Lots of change, the problem is likely your local government, as well as congress (though of course most, if not all media outlets blame the puppet).
Yes he continued an illegal war for oil that was started by his treasonous predecessor, but to state the truth at this juncture would incite a world war, he's got a shite job picking up after the war criminal before him. Also, you DO realize that congress and the military machine is where the power lies, executive branch is just for show now.
Clearly you have no idea how against civil liberties and how many terrible laws bush put into effect, while Obama went out of his way to look out for the little guy (that would be you and me both). Yes he continued a war he said he was going to end, also didn't close Guantanimo, however he in no way shape or form resembles Bush.

Sandra ^^ she is 100% correct, cannabis is safer than peanuts, WAAAAY safer than any pharmaceutical OR alcohol, as well as safer than stairs, ladders, and even many children's toys. With 0 deaths ever attributed to it and no apparent carcinogenic effect from burning (like cigs), look up the real info and next time consider a doobie after a long day and likely before a long, hard, night with you're main squeeze 😈😈
Bryan I'd rather have a cuddling chicken shit on me that life any day. Plus the chicken cuddles makes life's shit seem more acceptable :p
Actually Sandra, much of the smoking stereotype is falsified propaganda. What cannabis ACTUALLY does is strengthen the lungs and diaphragm, it acts as a bronchodilator (increases the amount of O2 one gets per breath, hence performance enhancing status), all while stimulating the hippocampus (the part of the brain responsible for memory, emotional response and the automatic nervous system. The reason it works as a medicine is due to the hard to get mineral we are naturally born with, but do not produce (in other words as we use our reserves to heal ourselves, we don't replenish them). Quite simply, that means cannabis is a plant we ALL should have a close tie with.

Honey, saying that men don't deserve a celebration is very much the same "feminism" that most outspoken feminists cry for, which in reality is just a sexist system with the other gender on top.
All coating a nugget of cannabis. Don't make plans after this bowl lol
Both probably extracted via heat press (the purple hash is begotten only via press to my knowledge).
Concentrated cannabliss
In other words, the celebrate the feminine and don't shame because of bodies. Wtf Amerika for breeding such gender based intolerance we expect every country to be as oppressed.
See, this is the kind of "feminism" (pretend equality) that is the problem in the first place (just in reverse). For actual equality BOTH should be celebrated (and female sexuality is FAR less oppressed there than here).

Incorrect, Onamacare is an initial attempt to give us what the rest of the first world has, universal health coverage. Your issue with it is STRICTLY related to your local government's unwillingness to include the intended state paid healthcare as part of the budget, therefore sticking paying customers with the bill for the less fortunate. Vote out your current regime and elect officials more willing to play ball. Georgia is not a likely state to make that change though :-/

Pretty cool spot ain't it? Be glad the mosquitos are pretty mellow, it's not far from there they are totally out of control. The meditation retreat I went to down the road had many buzzing distractions.
thats what I saw. Out of the myriad of dispensaries I went to slinging hash and hash smoking utensils, one was trying to do something. Admittedly the owner had been a lawyer prior to dropping out for a more rewarding line of work.
My job was going dispensary to dispensary, I kept asking "aren't y'all worried with the laws?"
The laws were already written and on their way through by the time I saw the first bit of unity start. The community assumed and didn't do their due diligence to protect themselves.
I worked for strain specific concentrates outta Seattle before having to move south, medical didn't 'try,' it was too late by the time they tried to unite.
Y'all shoulda created an uproar before it was too late. I witnessed people start to stand up after it was already set in stone. We have our battle for us because the community was lazy in Washington or was too busy playing get one over on the other guy to have any unity until too late.

What good do ANY laws do for the black market but make it see more cash flow.
Plus, how many legitametly purchased guns do YOU think are used to commit crimes?
How is that gonna help a thing?
Why penalize everyone for what criminals (who those laws won't affect anyways) are causing the issue?
Is there any other way TO look at it in a time when the governmental push is to remove our right to defend ourselves while giving that right exclusively to a group of people who clearly cannot be trusted with the responsible use of the trust given to them (that goes for the entire government's gun pointing for resources).
The bottom line is if gun safety was taught during childhood more respect for a dangerous tool would be had. I had my first gun put in my hands at 9, I have never felt the need to carry a gun (other than to exercise my right to do so), nor pull it out because of fear. However if I had my gun and saw someone using theirs in a way that endangered other people's safety or had already caused injury, I would pull it out and I would not miss. Unlike the cops who need 127 bullets to find out they were shooting in the wrong car, I would need one and then a call to the badges for the cleanup crew.

No worries, that's a difficult part of zombie lore that one only gets when they know cryptozoologists and the like. Then there are so many takes on zombies, rage virus type (28 days later (not zombies cause they didn't die first)), Romero (slow, dead, reanimated), racist (try to find pre-Romero), social commentary (we live in a society of addiction, if it's not drugs, it's work, money, cars, tech, news, social media, etc), satirical (bong of the dead, bloodlust zombies, etc), it can be overwhelming for those not so neck deep in the culture

again, it's all issues with your local reps, not the law itself
ps, Oregon has state funded Obama care, it's 100% free, we also do NOT have sales tax, nor are the tax rates through the roof. All the regular arguments against it are proven 100% invalid here.
The probalem isn't on the federal level, it is on your local level. Voting for Bern won't fix it, NOT voting for the local asshats currently holding elected positions and replacing them with folks that give a damn about the people they are supposed to be helping will nullifuy all of your condescension on the plan.
^^ the problem is the Republicans refusing to do state funded as Obamacare is meant to be. Because of their greed, you're very correct, it doens't work as it is intended to.

And most people pulling the gun in the first place do so out of a fear reaction, regardless of the situation. How is that not being a coward? I'm afraid so I'm going to pull and fire reflexively, most often without thought until after. It's the definition of cowardice.
It's easy to pull a trigger, detaching and requiring little skill and is usually not a matter of the more skilled opponent, but the one who didn't hesitate. Nothing special about it, any idiot can do it.
Unless you are referring to the new use of the word hippie, in which case you meant to say useless addict vs the hippie who had morality and was from a very educated background as the group the term was coined for :)
You realize many of us 'lazy' hippies know things like herbalism, enthobotany, chemistry, agriculture, wild foraging for edibles and survival skills. We're just not cowards that need to hide behind a gun to make that work. Go ahead and eat your doctor or the source of much of your food, we only make one meal that way and you go without nutrition, medicine, or some other such personal knowledge we have.
That would be true if we only had one response to danger and didn't already have the moral breeding to not take a life. Fight or flight dictates warriors and runners, in modern day America where most people don't know real hardship, struggle, or self defense, there will necessarily be a lot of runners/hiders. The problem is when it's kill or be killed and you turn your back to run you're just giving an easy target for a cheap shot.

That's like winning a jackpot every few lottery tickets, if all the winning tickets had their names and numbers known and were desperately in need of a coin to scratch an itch. Bad news, they likely don't filter prison water and so they will go without a vital life need.
I imagine any other state thusly interested in locking people up to get their cut of the $450 k/year for every person in their state prison might employ such a tactic and even take advantage of such an easy way to win the lottery. For every 3 people they arrest due to poisoning and offering what they SHOULD be doing to ensure the citizen's health they get $1.2 mil.
Georgia does this cute thing where they don't usually register you paid a speeding ticket (though the online pay site will go through like it works fine, much of the time it'll even take your payment). When the court date you don't think or should not have passes, guess what is issued?

What I know is that people who dared to hope independent would win is what caused Bush to be able to cheat his way into presidency the first round. Clearly Trump will be a colossal downfall for this country. There's only one choice in my mind, the one that has the BEST shot at removing any chance trump has. Fucker cannot and will not be prez.
Or were you too young to vote?
Didn't you learn you lesson with Bush?
He is also the only candidate who's only chance at succeeding is succeeding in causing enough people to vote for him to allow Trump to win. Do NOT throw your vote away and allow Trump to win.

Oh man, turbo-charge your dwc, add a secondary bucket with a pump. Put your water line where there's ~6" beneath the net pot and the solution and add a water pump into the secondary with a feed directly to your plant base. You add O2 via the drop into the solution below, plus make it easy for your plant to suck nutrients where it's easiest to send up the stalk. The reason for the secondary is so you don't kill your water pump with roots. :)

Wtf is up with this month and death this year.
Sorry to hear it man
Do we trust corporations to write their environmental impact reports themselves and believe it's true, or do we have an organization entirely separate organization that comes and verifies? Why is it that cops that have been proven rapists just get a paid suspension (or maybe unpaid) and left on the street for someone else to cleanup or to continue to do the wrong? Quite simply because the internal investigations is a sham. Why would they be invested in putting 'one of their own' where they belong for what I feel is a much worse crime than if someone who had no trust to 'protect and defend' had done it. Why, because they were not put in a place of power to defend the innocent (who have a second amendment right so they can not be pussies and defend themselves).
Sadly to win it takes both those inside the system tearing it down gently while playing along AND those on the front lines standing up to get beaten over and over and over again. Ghandi and MLK are the two that created incredible change. The path has been set, sadly the powers that be also learned how to subvert said momentum by false operatives. Old protesters know that the first person to throw a stone is likely a cop. I've witnessed it myself, plain clothes civilian pulls a brick out of the sidewalk and tossed it. Idiots in mass play a lot of follow along while wrapped up in the moment. When the idiots take up the charge, where do you think the guy that threw the first stone goes? If your answer was through a magically opened gap in the shield wall and into the group of cops, you're 100% correct.
My point, the constitution is not to give rights to the government, but limit those rights. In theory it is a great country, now that corruption has taken over via banking interests and other typhoons the meaning has changed.
And in the mean time shot an unarmed man
They dropped the rape case
You realize that Oly let him walk right? 365 days of probation and community service.
She KNEW she was breaking the law, clearly her SO was dirty and didn't care (and should also be put under investigation)
Constitutionally that is an illegal detainment and I do believe that citizens actually DO have the right to resist unlawful detainment by whatever means are necessary.
Plus what do you say when your SO says they don't care and to arrest me anyways
She had kids and gets shit pay, karma is already paying her
Had she had legal training she would've realized that put her in a massive liability had I been the vindictive sort and had say, pulled the public records and sued her and the city of Dekalb.
Had a cop arrest me and admit in her car in front of her dash cam she knew damned well I had not violated any law
^^ yet if there was a rigorous and difficult training program that required a lot of learning I'd imagine the proclivity to put innocent men behind bars would slow or even halt.

The funny thing is that the only reputable source I can find that semi-validates this statement is from high times. It's not legal per say, but medical is no longer illegal.
Though you will be hard pressed to be able to co2 extract
Extract of them that is, not the flower itself.
Yeah deff not bad, I just prefer not paying massive amounts for someone else to deal with my medication. Plus I find the cultivation experience one of the best parts. Look into the hemp laws there, I can point you towards a few strains that I can ship nationwide due to the THC content being under 3%
I'm betting the laws on hemp are much the same (under 3%thc is hemp by us law). Look into strains like Charlotte's Web, which has less then .3% THC. It is quite likely indeed legal in your area, though cops are too dumb to know. If you do have issues demand lab analysis which will prove it's legality and exonerate you.

Works better with BHO, also the glycol makes for a harsher hit, ideal is a 60/40 mix veggie glycerine/propylene glycol. The BHO doesn't wanna mix in so well so start with a drop of the oil on a silicon pad and use a razor blade to help break the BHO down into solution, adding a drop at a time till you have a complete mix.

I think you already have the first one, off to a good start
And I am simply saying I'm happy to see the cats gone. It has nothing to do with you and everything to do with the destruction of property :)
Damn, glad you're ok
Love, beauty, success :)
Cause we don't have health problems in America lol
Lol, both y'all there it seems.
Though it is flattering
There is no way this is close to correct, I know where I stand... This is not it.
Says the woman who is raging because I stood up to stop what's now over $2500 of property damage
My business and house are priority and its in my laundry.
He's leaving
The point is you have rage and would flip the fuck out.
One of my cats spends 90% of his time outside and meows at the door to go out, the other will be finding a new home because he goes in my laundry...
If what you fought for was being destroyed by pets that you weren't comfortable with to begin with you'd be livid. You go off the handle of Scott doesn't move fast enough for your liking.
If your expensive property was covered in urine, as I suspect it will be when you get home, wouldn't you be pissed too?
^^ is that cat urine that will stick in it for a long ass time?? I also had a tarp over the mat.
I'm replying on your thread, embarrassed your family will find out how inconsiderate of other's property you have been?
They pissed all over two expensive claiming mats jordan one retailing at 450 the other at 350, plus a 350 tent. It needed to stop then, instead I find this, plus my $50 drying rack covered in nastiness. Y'all have not done anything to put an end to the problem, I will not continue to allow damage to my property and house.
^^ you wanted to open a forum for complaint, I merely took the opportunity to continue along the same lines.
Good, glad you're taking responsibility for part of the damages caused. Now what about the damages to my property?
How is that living up to your word, being responsible or any of it? Do tell me.
You were told when your cat got preggo that I could not have more kittens in the house. I found out 1/2 way to y'all arriving there were two more than agreed upon. That is most certainly going against your word. When told OVER a month ago that the problem of your cats shitting on TWO of my businesses, one of which I sold everything I valued for, nothing has changed about it. Since you cannot be responsible enough to deal with the fact that $1400 in property damage has occurred, let alone the extensive damages to the house, certainly my $860 house + $400 per deposit, that puts you in the $2500 range of property damage.
It also usually helps to do what you tell the property management you're going to, but what do I know.
New damages
Mine too, rest assure you can take up the damages caused by your cats with Doe. :)
Woot, can't wait till my CLS arrives and I can start getting it all underway.
Absolutely.
I damned near got hit with two years for a two day old joint in my system, I had to plead forgiveness and sorrow for being sober while driving to avoid it. While in prison I met a guy who had robbed 4 banks at gunpoint and only had 2.5 years. Seems legit.

Agreed, I don't blame the cat, but something literally must be done, I am down to few options but.
Yup
^^ oh I know all this stuff and have already researched quite throughly. Though I may not be able to evict the roomie's quickly, the cats that are out of agreement can indeed be restricted from the property which acts much the same if they plan on refusing to remove them.
Do tell

Thank you sir. Believe me, I have a long list of tragedies. It was an outlook learned over time and finally from finding inner strength when I least expected it.
Never., for then the lessons learned from the tragedy wouldn't make you who you are today :)
Hitler at least had to cart the propaganda films around to show the masses, it NEVER hit them instantly when they weren't supposed to think.
Fucking 100% following those footsteps, it's ridiculous. The surest sign is how easy it is to indoctrinate the masses with the propaganda, a screen in every hand.

It's the immiscible nature of oil and water that make this extraction a very viable method, plus you KNOW at a gentle boil you're decarbing at 212° (water's boiling point)
Reserve a little hot water (or boil a fresh batch and pour through your cannabis to get the last oils out). Water weighing more pushes the oil to the top of it's surface, while the cannabis may fully submerge.
My hero
Ahh, see the main reason is simple, you loose none of your oil to staying in the ganja, strain while hot and the water and oil separate. If you put it in the fridge to cool you'll be left with a solid puck, no oil left in the weed and water ready to pour off.

My father put a Saturday night special in my hand when I was 6, set a can at the base of a tree and taught me how to use it. I shot it once and developed a heavy respect for a gun. Bottom line is people aren't taught anything but to fear a gun so of course they act like idiots around them.
Well that just makes it a pain in the ass for those of us that are responsible, the last attack would've had nothing prevented as not a single one of the bullets, magazines, OR guns used was legal in the state of California. Perhaps if hand guns responsibly carried been legal it would've stopped with 5 shots. Pity they trusted a force that takes at BEST 15 minutes to get there rather than .05 seconds from the barrel of a .45 to the sicko wielding the gun's chest.

Andrea, alcohol is a world of its own, it actually has a higher addictive rating that heroin or meth. Meth they are giving to your (or your friend's) hyperactive child in VERY small doses (aderal does the same thing to us) all while crying out how terrible it is for you, seems legit. Heroin itself could be used medicinally, as it was in the past, to assist those dying in living out their last few months pain free. Either way, those are very different than the organic benign substances we are speaking of.
Told you ;)
Group: Namaste
Andrea, as we can clearly see by cannabis turning out to not really have 'no known medicinal uses' (as it is scheduled), rather it has tons of them. Mushrooms are also being studied and are used successfully to end cigarette dependency and as a natural anti-depressant. That being said, you were taught only lies and propaganda (easily proved by the complete lack of scientific data on ANY 'illegal' chemical). That being said, with no data ANY claim can be made, crazy or no.
You realize that honest citizens aren't the problem. The folks in Cali were using illegal guns from the get go, in other words laws didn't do shit and still wouldn't. All it would do is raise the price for the gun, yet keep them readily available all while continuing to finance our 'enemies' via the black market deals the will then be making. What needs to happen is gun safety classes for everyone and get MORE responsible gun owners carrying their weapon. I'd like to see a nut at pop off more than 5 rounds if 1/2 the people they were firing at were both armed and trained.

Right, but if a cop takes 12-30 min to arrive and a bullet takes .05 seconds to go from gun to target, I'd want a responsible gun owner carrying near me if shit went down. Plus crooks will always have a black market, so you want only crooks owning guns (crooks and cops)?

Haha awesome
No I judge these cowards by the cowardice of their actions, not by a 'comic book standard.' Would only that my life was as easy as most, but alas it was not. I was homeless in Boston over the winter at 18. I have witnessed and defended myself against enough to know that he is a damned coward needing his ar-15 against a 2" blade. Especially carrying two weapons that range it, one projectile complete with aiming laser, both within easy reach. The point is he wasn't looking for a peaceful resolution, else he could've avoided murdering someone.
:)
It pays to live in Oregon :)
Dude he has a taser and a baton, both with further reach than a small knife. Yes, I can see plenty that says he took the cowards way.
Not like innocent bystanders haven't died to cop bullets too this year. Or a routine traffic stop ends in the death of an unarmed man. Clearly one can avoid being in that situation and STILL have the same result. #facepalm
In combat zone it's fine to waste someone for holding a tiny knife to your gun, you're still a coward for needing more than a taser, baton or other cudgel, but it flies. Holding a knife doesn't suddenly change the laws to make the police officer (who is not qualified to interpret the law) judge, jury and executioner, they simply do not have that power.
That the army trains people to end lives, not capture an innocent person (we are innocent until proven guilty here).
It's as simple as he is "innocent until proven guilty."
He is trained to handle such situations, the problem is he was likely trained by the army to end a life rather than protect it.
Right? Frankly it would tell me that these dolts are easy to make into our new shop.

Well I laughed at myself as being paranoid and then almost ru fuck needed it.

Karma is going to be cruel to you for your complete lack of compassion. As a Christian you better be prepared to face the Devil, the bible is pretty specific about judging and intolerance, as well as hate.
You realize that in their home countries the only people that benefit from Al Qaida (proven to STILL receive an intelligence paycheck from the CIA) and ISIS are the rich white folks in charge of the corporations that are simply laying claim to the resources in these poor areas right? In other words you need to start thinking critically about where the benefit is before you act like a bigot.

Just wow.
"Obama liberal politics" you mean helping those homeless people you just called to help? You do NOT like it in practice? Dude make up your mind, either you actually give a damn about people that are hurting financially or via their health and want to help them get better and therefor support his attempt to bring us up to the same standards that other leading countries have as far as health care. Of COURSE the corporations perverted it via bribery (lobbying) and now the price is outrageous for normal insurance, the company can no long deny folks (including several of my personal friends) health insurance. So basically you've made the claim of wanting to help, while bitching about actual help being put into place. Learn to think for yourself instead of letting someone else tell you what to think, you've clearly watched too much of the new propaganda and are literally attempting to make it sound like you aren't just debating using the words spoken at you.
Don't forget Boston
Ironic that ALL major scale terrorist attacks just so happen to fall in a day when they are running a drill of the exact same nature. Seems like maybe our 'drills' are far to real.

I think you must be confused with a media that changes every presidency (which doesn't exist). They use the same tactics and a majority of the oat outspoken channels are far from liberal and 90% of what they say is a lie (including the 'liberal Obama media comment). It appears your think what the idiot box tells you problem is out of control.
No, it's a media hype thing, everyone just thinks what they indoctrinate you to think with the instant bombardment of hype. The point is those that are directing directing the media propaganda machine do so with far more inclination to choose lots of white folks dying to center all of their frenzy in. How many news stories of someone of a browner persuasion blown up to such crazy proportions? Unless it's a push for our country to go kill them, you won't hear a fucking thing about it.

Texas only stands for 'Merica, not what's right for EVERYONE.
No, our government wants us terrified. To terrified to stand up for the last rights that once made this country great and now are but a sad joke on our founding fathers.
And was getting Israeli intelligence pay checks at the time of the 9/11 attacks. Israeli intelligence of course is CIA paid
They are our governments allies, the same as alQaueda (who was founded and trained by the CIA)
Impossible to forget when you don't pay attention to most of the BS news tossed at you.
You realize that we helped them rise to power to fight Syria, the weapons they fired in Paris, likely 'stolen' from our abandoned military bases in 'hostile' territory. That is called an arms deal and was the creation of their legitimate fighting force. How are they NOT our allies?
For that reason alone I post this instead of Paris. Not going to assist another false flag attack
I have posted jack and shit about Paris namely cause the info on ISIS leads me to believe they, like the French, are allies (if we really wanted them we'd have drone struck them while they caravans through the desert instead of allowing them to 'steal' military weapons and vehicles from 'abandoned' military establishments in hostile countries. That reeks of arms deal to me.
In other words, they are our allies and likely were firing US weapons of war in Paris.
You realize we are talking about yet ANOTHER 'terrorist' group that we helped put into power (just like alQaueda who was created AND TRAINED by the CIA).
Yes, I quite remember what happens when duder gets thirsty
My outrage leans more towards why are these people less important? Simply because it's not one of our allies attacked by a group almost entirely armed with US military weapons?

Nice, I'll have to look into it. 8 (9 in a few months) year master of two traditions, I have been studying several meditation techniques since then. I highly recommend Transcendental meditation, expensive to learn, but well worth it for the benefits gained. Vipassana retreats I discourage, their codes are fluffy comfort food as they lie to you. I was told that I would get severe migraines from my reiki practice and possibly go insane from my TM practice. As we were all sworn to no spoken lies and they were clearly making stuff up, I left and researched on my own. The retreat only teaches a partial technique and for those that naturally expand into further techniques, they are discouraged or booted out. The complete technique can be learned free here, it is a very delightful practice that has lots to give. I couple with my reiki, I call for it and then put my conscious only on the flow of reiki into my body, where it wants to go, even the feeling as it fills me and surpasses the limit of my physical body. I feel the combination not only gives me one hell of a treatment, but it draws my awareness naturally to how the energy flows through the body (mine, yours and everyone else reading along with us), where I tend to find my personal blockages, what they look and feel like, etc. Awareness meditation + reiki does not equal migraines, it more closely feels like a full body awakening, with lots of tingles. http://www.vipassanadhura.com

I mean if we consider for a moment that the group that attacked Paris did so firing US weapons they go from military installments entirely abandoned after our presence ended. If that isn't as clear a we sold our weapons to these terrorists as can be, then I don't know what is. With all the shady politics going on I wouldn't put illuminati, skulls, or whoever else out of the reign of possibilities.
Umm rawer

I do and it is, yall are guests in my universe, the same as I am in yours. Everything that gets thrown in your path is your responsibility for it is merely a physical manifestation of what you have going on internally. Our only hope for peace, cleansing the negative to only leave room for the light. If you can swallow the pill that everything in your life is your responsibility, you are ready for Ho'oponopono. Thank you for this post, I hope it helps many to find the light within themselves rather than continue to look outside.

They have never tested themselves, they never truly know who they are, nor how strong they can be. They live their lives in fear of the 'what if.'
I'm not sure what the property holds, but I am expecting chanterelles in high numbers, lobster mushrooms in smaller numbers (a parasite takes over a chanterelle to become a lobster) and likely oyster (black most likely, possible white too).
Also so stealing this lol

If all pharmaceuticals start from a chemical isolated from an organic source (mostly from a plant), then on must accept that there are amounts of natural occurring antidepressants, as well as all other types of drugs. Finding a viable and edible plant source for said starting chemical equates out to smaller doses of the drug, minus the poison that goes into it. Therefore one must accept that it is beyond possible that out 'issues' could be solved with a simple dietary change to include the chemical your body need but is clearly missing.

I disagree, they have the capacity just not the desire. Iq only means the speed in which your on board processor computes. A low IQ can come to the same answer as a high IQ, the speed in which the thought process happens is the major difference.
Lol, alligators ain't no joke, but damn if they don't taste good.
^^ my parents showed me discipline, the rest was questionable. Not only do I have morality, I am also strong enough to defend those around me that need it rather than turn a blind eye.
I have a serious problem with the actress that plays her. In the books Daenerys is supposed to be the hottest woman on the planet and girl you look 100x better. I think they picked her because depending on angle, she kinda looks like a horse.

Waaaay ahead of you brother :)
By your definition it would have been just as 'racist' had the man been from any other race, because he ended evolution with his photo. If it is applicable to ANY person of ANY race, simply because the evolution ended with their skin color, then it cannot be racism. Your argument is like a damned colander it has so many holes.
So it's racist to spend hours making an educational video all edited from one self portrait into a picture of the man that put all the effort in? Consider his photo his place in the credits for his hard work. Sure he could've added other photos, however then he would likely have to pay models, have a lawyer in staff (to draw up protective documents so he doesn't ultimately get sued for using someone's likeness). I don't think you have a full appreciation for all the work necessary to do that much continuous morphing on a photo, nor how much goes into adding other folks to your production.
You realize that this video took one person morphing his photo to match the phases we've been through rather than generating full images of the progression, right?
^^ well played :)
^^ I think truth is answering for it with studies that fiscally prove that kids raised in ANY extremely religious background have increased likelihood of being the school bully. It actually stands as viable data to show that morality isn't necessarily taught by religion, it's taught at home.
^^ if I see gangsters walk into an area I am hanging out I am LESS scared than if cops come in. Why? Because cops are men with guns who are legitimately out to get anyone else without a badge, whereas I was taught how to beat carnival games BY gangsters as a child. I had blown my parent money and a gang came in and cleaned the carnies out, all the stuffed animals won were gifted to the nearest child (me). As they won me any stuffy I picked, they also taught me the tricks. Sure they got in a tussle (read drive by) after they hung out with me, but what stuck? The kindness shown. When was the last time YOU got let off without a low cut shirt on?
Super cool
Frankly, I think maybe you might want to actually read the article.
You realize the study was an impartial study, never mentioning Catholicism and taking their data from multiple religions, not just Christianity or Catholicism, right? The findings are universal between ALL religious families vs non religious.
lmfao
It would seem my prediction has come true. Many small fires occurred today.
^^ I'm glad I'm out to saner and happier lands.
The Bible Belt is a tough place.
^^ omg yes. So very true
It was painfully obvious with merely a couple visits to the state
Love it right? Organized crime won lol.
:)
^^ I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that what may set you apart from the bad stereotype associated with religions is that you don't just hear the word, you think about it and how you can model yourself to live the love represented in there. Instead of listening to someone speak at you and saying I'm sorry once a week to feel better about the many failings we ALL have in living our spiritual best on a daily basis, you work to live it (which coincidentally means you have less guilt). For you it's not a Sunday thing, it's a day that ends in Y thing. It takes breaking out of those doors and thinking for yourself to achieve though. If the sell is "saved for saying I'm sorry to an invisible man in the sky once a week to clear you of your misdeeds on the rest of the days" then you might imagine the self reflection and betterment part is missed. The love we are supposed to show others jaded for one cannot love another if they have guilt on their mind (a form of self loathing). In other words, the guilt mind in incapable of love because it doesn't have love for itself, only scorn.
The mass media plan did seem to backfire with the addition of camera phones. Sure the NSA can watch me pick my nose, but we can also protect ourselves from abuse by the state.
coming from the Bible Belt, I got told weekly that I was going to hell because of a clothing, or personal style choice, is that any less offensive to you?. What I stated are facts, that I can back with scholarly sources, I said religion, except in the case of stating that your church has a proven history of moving the priests who commit heinous acts either across the country, or to another country that will not extradite so the offender never sees justice for his sins. There is no malice in that, it is merely an obvious hole in the moral teachers guise of morality. If anything by knowing the words of a guy I don't even believe in because I took the time to sit down and read the book, among other religious texts I've read, shows that I have a deep respect for the foundation set, however I cannot call myself a moral person and say I agree with the way it is practiced by those who claim to be so good with the verse they can teach others.
^^ religion instills a necessary us vs them mentality. Our invisible man in the sky, or yours? That leaves a vast swath of disconnect between you and someone who doesn't believe the same. Religion is beautiful, but perverted. All it preaches is love and all many of hem have done for the world is create a reason to disconnect and slaughter those that don't believe. Forget not that the Dark Ages were due to the Spanish Inquisition. A time where we believed in silliness rather than explore reality. Because of the church, we went through a period where our advancement of technology got delayed by 200 years. Religion has been the center point for killing as long as it has been around and the ONLY reason Christianity is so wide spread is that it was an easy choice to join up when it's that or die. Tell me again how religion makes people better? Love isn't a hard concept, Jesus was clear that loving EVERYONE Regardless was the mandate for getting into heaven, see to his las words, "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another" (John 13.34). Telling someone they are going to hell because of x, y, or z accessory they are wearing is far from love. Continuing to be a part of a church that protects child rapists (as the Catholic Church has a long history of doing), is far from honoring Jesus, God, or any other deity. Clearly there are big problems with what is supposed to be the 'moral authority' if they condone and protect child molestation.

50th anniversary acid test in Eugene tonight, Garcia Bday band playing. Sounds like our Friday's are pretty similar on opposite coasts. Dig it girlo, have as much fun as I'm planning on ;)
I may not know you on a personal level, but I have seen nothing that would make me worry about a child being in your care. No pictures of used needles, guns, all look incredibly wholesome, fun, and with a level of professionalism. Johnny law needs to go after real threats instead of making good people into monsters for a fucking lot of bucks.
Being adopted does too in different ways. That is some serious fucking bull shit. Seems like the state is after the money for taking a child, much like many states enjoy the money for locking an adult up for medicine.
Holy shit, how was this shit allowed?

Oh they are idiots for sure, I however can heal them through their own stupidity.
You hear me dying on the porch lmfao.
I summited having broken almost every rule they had my friend. Lol
I mean, idk bout you but I was not in agreement on ANY home visit. Different area code, good luck getting me to talk ;)
All I'm saying is that for the superficial rules broken we most certainly didn't deserve a beating.
I merely was a kid in the wrong place, tell it to yourself anyway you want. The cowards at Ascent were just that, cowards trying to instigate kids into anger so they could physically abuse them.
For what, being kids and enjoying the wilderness. The absolute worst I did was run away, why because that put me at drastic risk of death. Other than that the rules I broke were superficial and pointless.
^^exactly, he is supposed to be a role model for the children on how to properly handle a situation . All the class learned is that you aren't safe with cops around. Fear tactics = gestapo tactics.
Cause I think most of the times I got fucked over were bullshit and for pointless reasons.
Which time? Lmfao
Then again, shouldn't be surprised with an IQ limit to be a police officer, not a minimum.
Only cowards and idiots have to commit violence on another person to achieve a result.
Read, I have gotten one beating and it was a random mugging. You witnessed me ignore like ALL of the authorities at CEDU. I did not get beat, I just dug a whole fucking lot of stumps lol
A random mugging? Thanks
I have only been pounded once and that was a mugging and I assure you I've ignored more than 4 authority figures at a time.
Yes, yes we would. We are white, we aren't automatically viewed as combatants and therefore will get a nasty verbal confrontation vs assaulted by an authority figure.
Coming from someone forced into Hell, I wouldn't have expected that from you man. A pain in the ass can be dealt with in many ways that are not violent. Resulting to violence is a cowards way.
Also, apologize to your lady for your asshole of a friend that put the idea in your head lol.

The hard realization is that your rock bottom, my rock bottom and anyone else's are very different places. What may seem like rock bottom from an external perspective, may not indeed be rock bottom. Some poor souls are only there after its long too late to help. I was lucky enough to go to boarding school and miss the heroin fad that took out 4 of my childhood friends. What seemed like their rock bottom was far from it, theirs was in the deepest part of the ocean and not a damn thing anyone could do about it.

It may also just be fall colors, the plants suck nitrogen from the leaves during flowering (hence the yellowing effect). It just shows your buds are ripening).

She choose to leave to go be homeless in La with but a note. I just found out where she was the other day. She had been with a mutual friend, but left with two strange dudes who have no home. Idk wtf she's thinking. Emailed her dad, he doesn't seem to care. My hands are washed clean. I cannot be responsible for saving people who clearly don't want to be saved
It means I will no longer be wasting my time saving damsels in distress. It hasn't really worked for me so far and was a suggestion from a friend.

Three flavor a of medicated pumpkin spice cookies (different spicing)
Haha, I'm still stoned from all the testing while cooking lol. I'll give you a hint, it turned out really good lol.
Aye, anyone that can't live without yogurt and needs canna medication. I use yogurt in my cereal instead of milk mostly.
This batch is for lab analysis, they don't need flavor to tell me medicine content. Flavoring will be a separate mission with the remainder of the batch. After I have the recipe dialed down and know about what I'm getting through to the final product, I learn my final tweaks. :)
The way I look at it is if it works as a delivery system, it's likely marketable, especially say a high CBD version to deliver medicine and probiotics for some of the many digestive issues cannabis helps with.
It's going to the lab to get tested on Monday. I will have a full analytical readout on the TCH/THC-a and CBD contents. THC-a being orally inactive and useless until converted via heat. It smells and tastes like it's loaded.

Just one and he was dealt with.
Group: Arts Warehouse Planned Community
Not yet, but had I known permits etc was a problem... finding loopholes is what I do. I do not live in La, nor would I want to. I am a friend of Tink and have been speaking with her about ideas to turn otherwise unused space (such as a roof) into a green space that could generate income. The thought was tossed out about space for a mmj grow (a second location that a partner of mine would run) an idea that isn't a viable option and so a moot point. Either way I support Tink having seen her rise above some serious bullshit. I'm telling you, you ain't seen nothing yet. this girl got some hustle to her, her determination and inability to just lie down and give up will yield surprising results. Work together and the sky is the limit. As for sharing the dream, my contribution will be ideas to ultimately make the space pay for itself. I also went to school at a college that taught classes on this sort of commune, ie getting grants, 501c3, etc. I have a few tricks up my sleeve, but mostly I'm proud to see my friend pushing and pulling a rag tag band of artists, musicians, performers and builders. What yall have is multiple opportunities to create a team that functions as one, but is indeed many businesses all working in unison. Tink has a fantastic idea and it will work with the right group of people that are truly dedicated to the overall picture and brave enough to push for their dreams through the fear of taking that leap of faith.
Group: Arts Warehouse Planned Community
Group: Arts Warehouse Planned Community
Ahh, so you two had a falling out and now you are actively attacking her dream while Tink is occupied at work. Real big man running to demolish her dreams. For the record, this isn't the first plan of this nature, I have been present as she put this shit together before shit hit the fan with the animal abusing, child rapist up north. She has a strong concept and I know of 5 such warehouse/communities across the country (3 in Atlanta). All of them that I know receive yearly government grants and do very well for themselves. Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean it's not there. FYI, Google can find most things and the shit it can't find you can hit an even more specialized search engine, again and again.

I live in Oregon and a friend that has a few ideas to contribute. I'm just going to say that all of you that have reservations and have failed to do what is necessary to have been able to have the ball already rolling then YOU are the problem, quit making Tink your mirror and take responsibility for that fact.

^^ I figured I needed a closer to watery consistency, good looks man.
Me too lol
Boy isn't this the effin truth. Lookup Ho'oponopono, it's a pretty good practice that forces one to accept that everything in their life, good and bad, is their responsibility. Sounds scary right? Simple mantra to release it, powerful story of success to back it.
Here's a scholarly and reputable source to change your mind on the misinformation you were taught because no real studies were allowed to make findings to substantiate any of the claims that it is negative to your health. Here IS the study, decide for yourself.

You may have a good variety yet. The ones I pulled out of the farm were panaeleous coplandia (mainly).
I do see good colors for what I expect the spores to look like on the stem of the oldest in frame (chocolate to blackish)
The gills are whiter than I would be comfortable with, take a spore print for me (white paper and sit a cap on it covered with a Tupperware so airflow doesn't take the spores)

Noticed it with Obama and all the asshats he ran against, they isolated all but the crazy religious and hate groups (well over 50% of the population insulted verbally DURING the campaign, and that's just the sexist comments). Seems like if they wanted to win, these decisions would be obviously not made.
He is a man who is where he is because he has a total disregard for anyone else but himself, pretty sure that is the definition of a sociopath.
But at what sacrifice?
Because they think he can do the economy. Which he probably can.

That comes from our Air Force (which has a 100% success rate at grounding hijacked planes prior and since) running a simulation of the EXACT same circumstance at the EXACT same time. Instead of 4 possible planes, they had 36 choices, only 4 of which existed. So basically our 'enemies' living in caves in a third world country had the intelligence of what exercises our military would be performing prior to it happening. Seems legit right?

^^ yeah but Germans may actually like him, I have a feeling Mexico would be way worse for him after his racist comments
^^ right? The shit you hear on the radio these days, dude read a particularly raunchy chapter from his book. He got raped, violently after a long period away. (He tried to break up with the dolphin)

Sad if it takes going to church to be concerned for those around you. This is not something taught in church, it's something known by those striving to create heaven where it belongs and is real, as a state of mind. If Jesus vanished for 30 years and returned a shaman, he went to Tibet and came back preaching Buddhism. Tibet being the only place teaching spirituality at the time leaves Buddhism as the only possible learning he COULD have done.

Lmfao sharing this
Yet you say all of it like there is fuck all I can do about the crazy from my past that had it veiled incredibly well.
^^ yet I'm still sure you had your share of unstable people in your bed. Everyone has, everyone will
^^ the reality is its super easy for a woman to tie a man's wallet up for the next 18 years. Had a friend catch his lady poking holes in the condoms, she was already preggers at the time, just hadn't found out yet. Talk about entrapment.
^^ bingo. I heard her brother tell her about hearing dad call and mom deny him the ability to talk to the kids
Melinda, for someone that started by saying you didn't know anything about the situation you sure have a lot of judgement. I'm sure you've found your share of unstable men who you have allowed inside you which means you should be perfectly aware that unstable people are better than average at putting on a mask of stability. Plus EVERYONE puts their 'best' foot forward at the start, usually attempting to be the picture of the ideal themselves in their mind.
She wants to be just like her mother (who I'm pretty sure did something similar to their dad and told the kids something else, long story)... The problem with her plan is all her siblings and herself call mom crazy and don't like her much.
It's a backwards state
Lmfao, thats my old girl for sure
^^ lookup Ga laws, I thought the EXACT same. Was convinced she was going to the same place I would go, prison, for the same charge I would get for moving out of state without notifying her, kidnapping. I was very shocked to find that as a father that was there every day of the pregnancy and was told by all the nurses at the hospital that I should teach classes to other men for when their lady went into labor I had no rights and it was perfectly legal.

^^ welcome to America, a country that swears 2000% by the old ways and refuses to profess forward in a sensible fashion
All legally because as an unwed father, legitimated on the birth certificate at the hospital, I have 0 rights
Because she took my child and moved out of the state to a location I have only a town for.
That's completely terrible. Idk how people can be like that. It's so selfish and detrimental to the only important thing left in the forced relationship, the child.
^^ condoms aren't always 100%
Lol yeah, I do so enjoy seeing my thoughts laid out by other people
2 months and 12 days after I was born ;)
And in her case, I'm not sure she is responsible for her behavior, I hold the blame for all of her worst actions before we split. She has literally never taken any responsibility for ANY of her actions in the entire time I've known her.
^^ I figured saying she needed midol (she is a cut above the rest and needs it 24/7) was less likely to get brought up in court should she be indeed be stalking my page.
Strong selling points, but I'd consider myself pretty shallow if it only took three selling points plus a booty. Then again, I've learned my lesson the hard way. :)

Girl, not so sure that's a great ideas for you right now. Just sayin.
^^ let's just leave it as unsafe to do (considering it gets very advanced user/bad idea with anything further)
Add MDMA into the mix and you would be correct. But only because of the chemical required to make the DMT orally available
Beta carbolines don't react poorly with either mushrooms or LSD, but adding more DMT to the ayahuasca brew would be overkill. Basically you'd be a melted puddle for 8-12 hours and fine after.
^^ not likely, but you'd be really. Really fucked up.
^^ fuck franks ;)
^^ I still use it on everything lol
I am intrigued
It burnt quite well and got me very lit last night :)
^ I went into the wilderness with only swisher sweets to smoke my dank Cali nugs. Necessity meant that I couldn't waste a single wrap... I got it down now ;).
This one is nifty, what is it?
This looks like it will one day very closely resemble Yosemite, love it.
DMT is the one chemical that connects ALL life on this planet as we all produce it. Funny story, you're on it on a daily basis, technically. Just in really trace amounts, higher quantities in skitzophrenic's bloodstream interestingly
If you wanna carry a squirt gun to a gun fight, be my guest. I'll be the one walking back out of the shit storm because I chose to bring a .45.
Which makes it literally impossible to do anything but keep those that won't use them for harm from being able to protect themselves and their families from those that will have them no matter what.
Cute that you think that I don't think for myself enough to shun ALL major news sources and hunt out scholarly articles instead. Well placed straw man defense dropping your sources as if they were mine.
Apparently I need to get a cut :)
Look at the state's where anyone can get a gun, the murder rates are vastly lower than the prohibitory states. Statistics do not lie, stronger regulations only mean more deaths.
The problem is the black market will still have untraceable rounds and guns and the problem people will still have easy access, while those that can be trusted will not.

Nah, he's the king of straw man defenses, always making insane connections he knows makes zero sense. Male cops are NOT allowed to touch women like that, they have to call for a female or it's a violation of several procedures and criminal activity, but Alvin knows that.
Either that or isn't on the force anymore due to totally not understanding the law he was supposed to uphold.

It's 'to the pain' after that shit.

We have had a terrifying 5 months with him free, his 11 accessories still at large. They are our next targets, the good news is they point blank lied to the police when hey gave their reports. Olympia PD is a joke, sadly. The detective on our case couldn't find Google OR the correct place at the prosecutor's office. Fortunately, the prosecutor is less of a moron. Final evidence will be collected very soon to add at least one (if not way more) charges to his list. He will not see freedom again, each of the 9 counts of sexual assault carries a 20 year to life sentence and when he's done he'll have at least 10 (more likely 13-14 after drugging charges, kidnapping etc). He had my lady drugged and separated for three weeks before I was able to break her free.

^^ I literally got confirmation he was locked up seconds before you posted. I have a good friend who's a VERY good investigative journalist, the police that rolled on him had every avenue of escape covered months ago. Once we got the ball rolling on bringing our net down we were VERY thorough in our homework, the police had every one of his family's yacht call numbers, dock locations, houses, etc. Plus through good social media marketing we saw news articles posted in 4 languages. My girlfriend is the victim that still has her sexual assault case pending. I had to put my rage somewhere or wind up in prison for ending a rapist, I'll take 'to the pain' over death any day. This sicko will get out of the infirmary to go right back for new stab wounds for the rest of his life, labeled as a child rapid and an animal abuser.
Lol, I post good cops plenty often as you well know, I usually tag you. It is simply not my fault that there are so very many bad cops out there, however it's through viral networking that the victims of the criminal element inside the police helps them actually see justice rather than being another number in the just-us system.
Lmfao, I'll let you knew man

I an the one that called animal control for the animal cruelty charges, the rest came out after his face hit the news. I have been in contact with animal control the entire time and was notified last night that I no longer have to be afraid of him being at large, he is safely back in jail.

^^ good to know.
^^ from what I heard while traveling (literally everyone near me), all of them had a bad experience with them and won't be booking them again.
Oh right, and the baggage fee was also double what most airlines charge, I paid $55 to have my bags lost. Yeah they get a 0
They almost doubled the price on me during checkout ($291 ticket became a $425 ticket), not a single plane was on time, my luggage lost, no help from those responsible for finding it (the baggage claim number goes to a full voicemail) and the person I spoke with at home base, yesterday, was useless. I never got the call from her supervisor, nor did I get the call that my bag finally caught up to me. It took me calling in, still complaining about the missing bag to get the rep to even tell me it was here in Atlanta. I could have gotten a delta ticket for less and had less issues, Spirit really bent me over the rail

He probably wouldn't have gotten away with it as long as he did if he wasn't good at covering his nutso. The charges filed today are from an assault that took place ~9 years ago
Pierce county PD is apparently capable of doing their jobs, OPD not so much. More charges pending, should the detectives ever decide to do any detecting.
I called animal control and got his face on the news for his animal abuse, from there the calls came pouring in.
Right? Got his bitch ass ready to be Bubba's girlfriend in prison.
He raped his 6 and 14 year old cousins 9 years ago (the charges filed are their cases).
Thanks my dear, couldn't have been happier to hear the news
And what he did to the children and adults he violated. Frankly I think his 'help' will come in the form of a shank.

I wrote literally every state rep pointing out that following Washington's rec law is ridiculous as Colorado has the only successful system going. Why? Because they gave every medical Mj business that wanted on their rec license too. They kept the industry in the hands of the already successful businesses that had control to begin with. Washington effed up hugely and has put businesses in the ground. Each and every one of those businesses should sue the state IMO.
Lol

Thanks Lisa, although twill just be me this round. Pretty sure I'm taking the 40 this time
^^ this party is a little something different, literally a 4 block radius becomes a huge party with 11+ stages, free of charge, all volunteer run. All because a group of people advertised the party. Last night's cop entrance was enough force to likely END any of the after parties.
Dude I may have wondered past you and had no idea then lol. I was very far from sober :p
No, but he kept asking leading questions about the fun we had been having, talking about how he had a lot of fun himself, almost falling over yet strangely not slurring in the least, then following the group I was with to the point we split ways to ditch him. Pretty sure he was working his way into the party to make said cop hell happen.
Holy crap was that fun :)
^^ probably, but was nowhere near sober enough to give you a for sure lol
What's crazy is that I STILL cannot find any news on what the shit went down

Doctors need to start saying "I am sorry it appears your child suffered from severe stupidity. The stupidity was so severe that he put lit fireworks on his head and did not survive the resulting explosion." Or something to that effect.
^^ it already did, positive energy attracts positive energy :)
Frankly in war time he who brings life saving medicine behind enemy lines is known as a hero, all underground growers in prohibitory lands get that title in my eyes.
If not, all one need do is grow ONE lb of marijuana and make RSO with it. ;)

Supporting argument being overpopulation, we can't feed everyone, why waste the energy on a idiot that would blow his own head off with fireworks?
Here's the problem, idiots shouldn't survive according to Darwin, we've made so many laws to protect idiots (in fact idiots are more protected than endangered species) that they equal to more of the population than the desirable intellectual class, much of not most of our current problem. It's sad, yes, but someone's own child's idiotic death is natures way of saying they 'are the weakest link,' something we should do more of IMO.
Duuuuude, I am so sorry to hear this, at least you got this info in this day and age where you can turn to your friendly neighborhood hippie and find healing :)

Call them out on it on Twitter and tag Western Union
^^ my ex totally could, but that's another story lol. I watched her carefully set a down stem onto the counter and watched it snap in two.
You may want to look into that, it sounds suspiciously like they suggested you commit the felonious crime of fraud. I would take that online and shout it from the highest mountain tops, of financial institutions are WAY out of hand.
Dude you have worse luck with glass than my ex and she could break a pipe from across the room lol.
I've been in a Twitter/social media war with them since, I suggest you do the same. @moneyGramMe and ask about employee's telling you to lie ;)
If 'common' sense were so common everyone wouldn't need it.
Expecting me to pay to wait two months to pay my rent. I sucked it up and paid $55 at some seedy check cashing place. Do NOT go with MoneyGram, they are fucking awful.
Money gram took my money for rent, which turned out for some reason couldn't be cashed. When I tried to return the product that wouldn't work, after driving 40+ miles, to 4 different stores, they told me they would refund it in 65 days for a $15 fee. FUCK those guys
Lol, they did that to me not long ago too. Then tried to charge me to refund my rent money. Fuck MoneyGram
Upon second thought, I think IQ requirements for breeding makes MORE sense, less retards = less people so dumb they do shit like this dumbass.

So very true. It's so hard to forget the trauma's of our past and allow ourselves to feel instead the joy of what is.

Look up #seedToSale and you'll see why. The contingency plan has been set to hand the marijuana industry to corporations. Washington has already experienced a loss of legitimate medical marijuana businesses across the state because they were too slow to act to stop it. Please help us fight OLCC as they try to do the same here in Oregon. Until this trend can be overturned do NOT vote to legalize in other states. The more states that follow suit, the harder it will be to overturn. Oregon and Alaska are the front lines for marijuana freedom, NOT the sign of victory all around. Help spread the knowledge of what seed to sale WILL do if allowed to continue.

Proof nature hates women with this meme. It's what yall get for trying to kill us men in the womb. Also why if you have 3-4 boys you WILL most likely have at least one homosexual child. Why?

Incorrect, the placebo effect DOES contain healing. In fact science cannot explain as to why it works
Also, very well placed straw man defense. I applaud your effort to make a ridiculous tangent out of the comment. Get your church in check and people wouldn't have issue with it
It represents the VERY real persecution that everyone else in the country that does not follow Log almighty on a daily basis. Welcome to the real world, we are all persecuted against. If you are offended at the return persecution by a minority of the population, then it's pathetic and childish. You religion has done nothing but enforce itself on those around it and when the people start to stand up and say "ENOUGH," it becomes a group sob story of the persecution. Welcome to the real world.
Should I go on or is 5 in 45 seconds since your post a good enough showing that there are mountains of that material?
Todd Akin: “If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways of shutting that whole thing down” - mid 2012 Senate Campaign
2. Clayton Williams: “If it’s inevitable, just relax and enjoy it” - mid 1990 Gubernatorial race in Texas
How many recent politicians from the church have used lines like "enjoyable rape," "God willing rape," "legitimate rape," etc in the past few years?
If you want that shit to stop, stop the idiots from bleating their bigoted, racist, sexist filth and making it our fight to stop them from fucking those of us with some sense.
How does the majority of he bad that comes with the church not merit shit and eye rolling.
Gay hate as well as racist ties lie with the church
Anti-abortion, rape endorsement, all from the nut bags at the good old Christian church
Actually 33% of the world are Christians, including 70% of the American population. Tell me how I'm not outnumbered?
The latter being the only way we will SURVIVE ourselves
^^ the problem with religion, so does everyone else and it merely separates us into sects rather than brings us closer as a species.
Hell christians have yet to have really been persecuted in our history, while have been responsible for most of the global persecution throughout history. Get over yourselves
You don't hear the rest of us bitch and complain about how we're being persecuted as time after time Christians enact laws that screw free choice. Stop whining and realize that with your belief has come the weight of most everyone around you believing the same. Those of us outnumbered have the real end of persecution and have throughout history. You are whining at what the rest of us have faced our entire lives, persecution my ass, what goes around...
Jesus as a person is a misconception or intentional edit, what is really depicted is the sun of god, what primitive farmers would have worshipped (that which gave them food and relative safety)
Exactly, this article has big pharma's approval/funding you can bet your life on it
^^ bullshit, science has also proven that the placebo effect exists, yet they don't know why. Homeopathy works to a degree for those that are under its effect. Therefore science can NOT prove that homeopathy doesn't work only until they can disprove placebo effect. Quit acting as a rep for big pharma who's drugs all are made from a plant derivative, isolating a particular chemical and then altering it and refining it to stronger levels.
Christians today perhaps could strive to atone for the cruelty of their ancestors who slaughtered anyone who believed something just as crazy to be true.

The bottom line is treating people with a medical disorder as a criminal is douchery at its best.
The detective could neither find Google, nor the prosecutor. In the 5 months the case was lost the department even managed to shoot themselves an unarmed black man. If anything comes of it, it will be 100% due to the animal control officer hounding them to stop ignoring a violent crime and do their jobs.
Actually, the police were total fuckups, it's animal control that has made anything successful.
The black artists that are all very well educated and merely puppets of the white run world around them simply promoting everything that keeps their people down? They are worse than their slave owners.
Seriously, have an area where the power companies are boning their clientele, show me how you feel by adding dicks to their lines hahs

The entire system is designed to keep minority's (aka low income families) uneducated. As a lack of education means a lack of job offers these people are left desperate to make it in a world bent on using them as a stepping stone. Crime rates are nothing more than desperation rates.
Alvin, statistics do not lie. The numbers factually prove that the law results in racially unequal arrest rates, which would indicate those making, or those enforcing the laws are racist. You can't argue numbers dude, they are the same every time, unless you effed up.

I'm not worried about Ph, been pulling super filtered water from the store and carting it home. Trying something new today and using the tap water (ph ~7) plus some lemon rinds (acid = ph down) in the nute brew cocktail. Added some extra sugar for the bacteria to have a super boost (SOP for when I add water in), and a round of nutes (plus some extra kelp for them to munch on).

I got a TON of practice running an omelette bar at a university in Arizona. I ran 4 burners, all cooking omelettes for ~2 hours every weekend morning, non-stop. Plate count usually was around 250+/shift over 6 months employed there. That something crazy like 12,000 omelettes cooked over my employment there.

Ibogaine is a treatment that is, of course, illegal in the United States. It was accidentally found in the 60's by Dr Lotsoff, who at the time was hooked on heroin. Like many junkies prior and since, he was on the hunt for a bigger better high. Hearing of a root that an African tribe ingested in their coming of age ceremony that translates roughly to "breaking open the head." Basically they eat this psychedelic root unroll they meet their ancestors. Any who, Lotsoff got his hands on some and partook, what he found was surprising. He went through his withdrawal and detox without the classic symptoms and came out of the trip having no desire to use and has been clean since. It has fantastic anti-addictive properties, particularly with opioids. Methadone was created by the Nazis because their heroin supply was dwindling and suboxin merely delays the inevitable withdrawal, as long as you can afford to pay for the pills. Fuck that garbage, it's just something else to get the addict addicted to, not a cure.

He was a rescue an ex got, but as he did like $16k worth of property damage in her parent's town home he was ditched with me. He's very well behaved now, his learning curve was on the incredibly slow side though. As in he ran into the same wall multiple times daily for a year and a half before he figured it out, he's spedcial
I have a beagle/chihuahua/wippet/asshole who's like 25 lbs. He plays real serious and Henry wasn't so sure about it lol.
I have seen ibogaine used very successfully to treat opiate addiction, never seen herbs although I can absolutely see the power during a non-ibogaine detox. It is used to treat all the symptoms of withdrawal, minus the hot/cold bs. I bet it would be very helpful in tincture or edible during detox, smoking may be a bit much for ye olde churning stomach.

A little perspective for your comment, America not being greedy would help the homeless. There are 14 empty houses for EVERY person on the streets. How the hell would a heavy box help a homeless person. A job would help them, a home would help them, mental help would help them, rehab would help many, a fucking box just makes a warm fire for a few nights.

There may be no trash cans on every corner, but there sure is a lack of garbage all over the streets. Zoom in incoming ;)

This country only cares about war for money, racist bigotry, our defense budget and CERTAINLY not things like education, quality food standards, healthy options, giving a damn about the environment. We have pissed off 60% of the world and expect our allies to not attack us simply because we have more nukes than anyone else. All the while making false flag operations to push us into war over resources we are using to kill the planet for everyone else. We are ONLY number 1 in citizens incarcerated and not even in the top 10 for most other standards. We have also almost single handedly destroyed the planet. We deserve nothing but scorn.

Fuck Alderan, I don't like it anyways.
Also they caught him in the act of trying to destroy the evidence of starved animals by smashing them against the wall and choking them. The police got him with the animals blood all over him and let him back out of the car to continue to terrorize us.
When they raided him, he was placed in the back of a sherif's car. I sat on my trailer (right in front of said car), smoked a cig staring into the tented window KNOWING he was watching, got in my car, sent the letter that got him evicted and BK, came back, sat back down on the trailer staring right at him and smoked another cig smiling at the blacked out window.

For educated people you rappers sure do a lot of promoting the SAME negative stereotypes that keep those not as fortunate to have as good an education down, spending all their money on shit that is useless (bling, drugs, guns) and acting like 'thugs' cause their role models do. Slavery is very much alive and you sir are the one helping keep the negative stereotypes on your people. You want to see the end of racism? Do like they did in the 60's and write uplifting songs, or will your slave masters not allow you to give a message of hope and peace?

Name calling is certainly better anger management control than striking someone, not by much, but it's still healthier.

Frankly, I sleep better with cannabis plants in the room due to their incredible rate of turning CO2 into O2. More oxygen means easier relaxation time. The leaves are amazing in a salad (and loaded with phytonutrients), plus the icing on the cake of cheap AMAZING weed.
^^ my favorite part of the process personally.
So if you hit someone you are taking the risk that instinct will take over with a 50/50 gamble that fight is NOT what instinct lands on. Being smaller than the person you hit probably reduces your chances of flight being the primary option. If you are lucky their fight is a lot of bark and no bite.
^^ it is ok for neither to hit either person. Get hit in the face by someone, I promise you'll see red and IMMEDIATELY be enraged. Why? Because fight or flight response is a perfectly natural instinct and the adrenal surge from the rage is in part to help kill the pain.

Never said all cops are evil, again using a straw man defense. I AM saying that police get off on murder and other charges by lying to protect each other, or ignoring the blatant misuse of the trust put to them. As such, there needs to be more measures taken to ensure that they are indeed qualified for the job and can be trusted to hold the weapon they are given. Clearly with the statistical likelihood of getting shot at a routine traffic stop being so high, many of those we have trusted do not deserve such trust.
^^ someone had to cook that fucking pizza, or train him to do it ;)
You may note we are far from the top and drop further back every year. I agree that our unchecked breeding is a massive problem, but with the wages what they are, many parents don't get to take a breath of air between jobs with a minimum wage of $7.25 and bosses that demand all ones time. Tough to manage both full time work and family if the best you get is that low.
Not so sure how well it would work in Atl, I got arrested as a victim of an accident and attempt to scam my money and on the way to jail the officer stated in the car that she KNEW I had violated no laws. It cost $1000 to not violate any laws and still go to jail. Almost as bad as my trip to prison for a DUI 0.00
That dude was all, "well fuck what do I do now that I'me going to go viral harassing a peaceful protested. "
Right? They musta cowered in the ground in humiliating ways perfectly for the cops to not get beaten to death while cuffed.
^^ yes because a cop that goes to jail gets what he deserves in there, probably why they don't usually see time in the clink.
^^ right, but in Ga the laws are designed to screw citizens and favor business. During the recession Ga did ok due to the businesses packing up and moving to where they don't have to give the employee a reach around while they bone em. Having been to a school for "at risk youth," I know first hand how sloppy those programs are and frankly, these kids would be doing much better if they had a decent education. I was quite the trouble maker, when I was bored. Classes were all too easy, never did homework and still crushed every test and passed quite well. However, I was bored to tears and ready to get into mischief. All those places do is teach you better ways to get around stuff and scar the children. What NEEDS to happen is parents forced to those programs for using the almighty television as a parenting replacement, cause that is often where the fault lies from my experience. If parents were taking the time with their kids the kids clearly need and the schools were invested in making education fun and interesting (especially to those smarter than the average human), then I'd be willing to bet that the number of issues would drop. Remember the crime rate is usually closer to a desperation rate. If the money and ability to easily survive is not available, a job isn't forthcoming and you are about to loose everything, a knife pulled for a wallet can start looking more and more enticing.

They need a real fucking education, sadly our government does not provide a budget for low income neighborhoods to have decent schools. No education, no fucking job, see why the crime rate might spike in a skewed way? The crime rate is nothing more than a desperation rate, would you roll over and let everything go to be homeless or would you fight with all your worth and do whatever it takes to survive?

If you think about it and accept the Big Bang theory and the evolution that comes with it, from the burning mass of planet escaped the gasses that made the atmosphere and became water. From water plant life sprung which made the oxygen we breath and ultimately mutated a mobile version that eventually became land creatures better able to propagate and spread the plants. The earth beneath your feet matches all the creationary bits of god except the ridiculously absurd time frame. God as you know it has never been above you, nor out of touch, it has been under us this entire time and we are killing it.

No clue
It's amazing these people live long enough to say this shit to the media, let alone not have an obituary the day after their quote is aired.
Or not solid enough to carry the weight to make evolution scientific law.
Because it's unsolvable dude
I'm not sure if it's an idiot who found religion, or if religion makes idiots (the dark ages would be my proof)
Plug it in and solve it is EXACTLY where that equation falters and why it's not law. If the bit isn't repeatable every time, it's clearly got issues.
The only reason it wouldn't be a law is in the equation James. Our schools teach that Columbus found America (a lie), that our forefathers were honest and good people (here have a blanket to keep you dying of small pox, clearly also a lie). Just saying that the reason it's not more than a theory is there MUST necessarily be an issue with the equation.
Jason, but evolution is beyond provable, it just doesn't boil down to "E=MC(squared can't find the DAMNED key)"
Well then James see to my comment on what scientific theory is and why Jason is 100% correct that it is a theory (no mathematical equation can be made).
It is far from religious to believe in a theory that has irrefutable data backing it, ALL data taken to back it at that. Religion relies on 0 evidence, little to no historical accuracy (except maybe Buddhism I'm not as researched on it as I should be) and absolutely no data to support it as rational thought over just being a primitive society explaining all the things that were unexplainable and scary. Give it magic properties and all of a sudden it makes sense.
Jason see the above for a realistic definition of theory in terms of science
Because it will ALWAYS be presented as a theory. The only way to become scientific law is to break down into a mathematical equation (numbers never lie). As such, it is the only theory that has all scientific data backing it, from here through the time we can check back to.

Here's the problem, the only 'history' of Jesus that hasn't been proven to be a forgery by the church is the bible. Even though there were historians of the age that recorded what was happening. If ANYONE had fed thousands with 40 fish (a trick any chef can do by making a large round of soup), one of said historians would have been inclined to mention such a 'miracle.' Not a single one did. The misconception is a simple one as the entire Christian religion is pilfered from 15 prior religions with a similar story (different names in their storybook). There is nothing new, original, nor factual about the bible, it is a storybook designed to teach one simple concept that we cannot seem to grasp, love. The same concept every other religion is attempting to teach. We just have migrated into believing these stories as history. The only historically accurate thing about it, is that it's old ass shit.

Cept Obama is cleaning up after Bush fucked the country up so his family and the Bin Laden family could make billions off a war with a country that had nothing to do with the alleged attack against the country by a family friend of George Bush and LONG time business partner.
Good
Another reason to give Texas back to Mexico
I don't blame you.
Lol, I kept 10g for myself between the two plants. This is Shakespeare's Dream, the connoisseur strain from a Kali myst x green love potion cross (again 3 canna cup awards from the same immediate family tree). It lasted me so much longer than an ounce ever has lol. I'm very pleased with my crosses and had to come west to see if'n I could launch the lines successfully. Canna cup watch out ;)
It's coming
I am fortunate enough to have visited 3/4 legal states, Alaska is the only state I have NOT been to and it seems I have a reason if I am to play collect them all.
Yups, Oregon.
^^ 1/4 lb plant, flowered with fluorescent (online says is bad for flower if blue spectrum bulbs are used), of course using blue spectrum bulbs, in a closet I could not regulate temps in to save my life (75° in bedroom, °90+ in closet). She was potent enough a bowl packed for wake and bake would cash at bedtime
This being the end result.
^^FREE seeds
The law went into effect on the 1st... The local cannabis church (yup it's a religious sacrament) gave away seeds to celebrate. Lavapit Kush (lavender kush x pitbull).
Meet Shakespeare's Harvest, genetics of my own creation via a Kali Myst x Black Russian cross. Her immediate family, father and mother side grandparents are ALL canna cup winners. :)
^^ lol me too. Sucks with all the beans I have in the ground lol
Nuetral ph water and some organic nutes, plus the bubbles and you'll be good to grow. If you want some more detailed suggestions, or even some designs for your selected grow space, that is part of what we are starting up with Shakespeare's Gardens. My partner wants to design and build grow rooms (private and commercial) and we know a thing or two about this lovely plant :)
I tend to do hydroponic grows myself. I like the ease of knowing my crop is good if I say take a weekend trip. Your local garden supply store will likely carry a 5 gallon deep water culture kit that is easy sauce to use and like $40. Misconception about hydroponic is the complication. All you need to grow hydroponically is basically aquarium goods (air pump/stone and maybe a water pump depending on your system). The only specialized item you need is a way to measure PH (at least to start).
Carefully :p
Just borrow a friend's address and make a round trip ;)

The bible says "if a man is to lie with a man he must be stoned." For the nations christians to survive gay marriage they must legalize weed to save their souls ;)
Cannabis is a weed, it's pretty easy to grow. Just remember that the label on the nutrient bottle lies horribly, use 1/2 the recommended serving or watch your plants die from nute burn

6 Willow sprigs, 4 sprigs of Japanese maple (two kinds), 2 sprigs sugar maple and a bunch of Mullen leaves (tobacco alternative).
Fuck consumer culture, make it chase you ;)
However I have no rum
^^ good thinking :)
Winning. I'll have loads of beeswax starting next year, do you make lotions and the like?
I cannot, it is across the street from me. Even when I'm away from it, it's still right there. You can't imagine the stress
Idk why I thought that was atlantic, probably because it's pretty terrible to think how fucked that ocean currently is, trash excluded.
Dude, what an amazing coop
Holy giggity.
Sexy ladies
It was awful having to sit, swim and play with the dogs, you don't even know.
^^ no it falls into the Atlantic where it creates a trash pile the size of texass
You can then use the leftover water to root cuttings more resistant to rooting from cuts
The talk fronds sticking out are weeping willow fronds, put them in water and they naturally create the rooting hormones ;)
^^ she is right, it is a very popular rumor.
^^ glass is more expensive, plus pallet accidents destroy product. The profit margin would decrease
Looks ill dude
Miss the shit out of you girlo
I would have to see a LOT of evidence to believe this shit with the massive push towards war with Korea. "The Interview" begot threats that if show know in theaters Kim Jong Ill would declare war on us, so what do we do? Release it to Netflix of course.
Jeabus man
^^ yes thank you,
Gatorade bottles are not recyclable, I will be boycotting them from now on, no bottled water bottles that we found were accepted, sprite is not, nor any other soda bottle found. The ONE we did find was chocolate milk. So boycott the shitty drinks and go ahead and get choco milk, way better for you anyways.
Small fucking wonder we have the garbage pile off the east coast.

And absolute 0 nutritional value, made by a CANDY company. What you are giving him is candy, they are 100% correct

Made by Ferra CANDY company
And how many grams of sugar?
Unless you fit into the tax bracket with Donald Trump, then you still are a slave. The sad reality is that is 99% of the population.

Mind = blown where have you been all my life with this stuff. Second time you've melted my mind with a video shared.
We already allow teachers to diagnose our children with mental disorders (I know my add diagnosis first came from a teacher) and now decide what's healthy or not. Next they'll be able to arrest our kids and beat them.
There is ALWAYS a polite way to let someone know they are a total douchebag. ;)
Congrats brother, really wish I could be there to see you, it's been far too long.
I believe that was our entrance to both world wars, getting attacked for selling arms and bleating like sheep that we didn't deserve it.
Likely they just build their illicit market using "laws" and pay someone else to do the dirty work while collecting funds from both sides of the fence. Frankly that's been America's MO for a long time selling arms while claiming "neutrality" to get us involved in war for profit.
I am a new found, solid Adidas loyal customer cause if this.
If you don't like it, don't think about the wicked fun that they are having instead of you.
^^ I shame no one with this, there is nothing sacred about marriage, who cares if three people want to share bed space?
Congrats
I'll post a photo of the ridiculous garb I fashion to prevent such incidents lol. Today I'm going in shorts/tee to plant my trap, once I capture something I'll have to decide what to do from there (could be today, could be next week).
So cool right? Proves sharks only attack because they are curious, not because we are seen as food. They spit human they bite into back out, we don't taste good to shark apparently.
As you may remember I don't have any protective gear aside from YE olde snowboard gear lol. It's going to be a fun experience. Today I'm setting my swarm trap and may yet end the day carrying a box full of bees down the railroad track and back home, but it'll likely be a day or so, I just don't want to wait too long and miss the swarm
^^ I'm taking the barefoot approach. It seems cruel to me to make the bees so fearful for their lives from the smoke they gorge themselves on honey and ignore all interaction. I've seen numerous bee keepers that roll barefoot and am going to try my hand at it. I expect stings, but can use more natural methods to prevent a massive attack, plus I can armor myself against an attack with duct tape and snowboarding clothes (for now).
At least we aren't saying "poor Aj found the ground wasp's nest." I have been thinking back to Tucson quite a bit as I prepare to intentionally capture and house a swarm of NON Africanized honey bees.
Lol
Looks fun
^^ precisely why I am actually totally ok with the Africanized swarms that can take over most of the states. The definitive factor is their ability to survive in Las Vegas and Flagstaff, Az due to the extreme temperature changes. As they can kill a human and will aggressively attack anything near the hive till its dead I presume they will be the reason bees survive.
I say beating cause they bleat like they are being beaten to death, it's ridiculous.
We totally should man
Oh dear? Was it a good dream?
It IS rather lovely out here
I like to calmly remind the Christian crying "persecution" that because of their religion we suffered what is known as the "dark ages" and that because of the persecution put on EVERY other creed throughout history BY Christians that it may be their turn to take the beating. ;)
Way to win that round
So jelly, enjoy the show

Also, I did a tutorial to learn how to do this stuff. Basic work, done by a true expert.
So cool
Oh yeah? Fire me some more info girlo.
Sounds delightful, enjoy the rest of the afternoon :)
^^ a live hive of bees, complete with an exit to the building (through a PVC pipe). They have been given a reptile cage (at least it looks like one I had considered purchasing for a Burmese Python) to build in. You are looking at a VERY pampered hive of honey bees.
^^ which is designed with a body modeled after the Les Paul ;)
Amazon is my best bet
Rawer so hot
^^ now that is beyond a lie, I'm sure you, like everyone else in the country, have broken the law. I'm going to guess weekend drinking and driving, speeding, rolling through stop signs, etc. of course the ability to get a job and work comes with education which you are sure not going to get in an all black neighborhood. I'm sure that means that you went to school in one of those neighborhoods and are speaking having gotten the lack of education that one can expect, rather than the education of privilege found at predominately white schools. ;)
Psh, just one? They gave me 4 and I was still asleep in the hole in under an hour. Yay rage release :)
I am SOOOOO going to have some serious shit next wrap dude. I can't believe you would post something like this. ;)
^^ clearly been under a rock as the statistics that are giving the "racism" movement credence have been being taken for years. 1 in 13 black men will see the inside of prison, 1 in 36 white men will. Statistics and numbers don't lie, racism has been around you're just part of the white privilege problem that allows it to continue. ;)
He IS a stinker though ;)

Technically a separation of church and state would mean either they include an icon to represent ALL religions, or misrepresent what little shred of respect we can have in the constitution (and likely incur lawsuits because of the clear tie between church and state).
As I remember I twice had cops on my ass for trying to bail your ass out too ;)
Yeah, we did too. Good times
Probably not, but we'll see

Yeah, we were there with him just at a different campus ~20 min down the road from there.

Yeah, the reality of our situation PRIOR to Fukushima was grave enough I worried if mine will have a planet to inherit.
Ironically as we have become more "civilized" we have developed more ways to end life than save it. I don't honestly believe society is using the word correctly, our insistent need to be able to more efficiently hunt another human proves there is nothing civil about the society.

If God loved us we wouldn't be under attack from radiation in one side of the country and a trash pile the size of Texas on the other coast.
I didn't mention the scope of the issue in the original post lol. It's a crucial plot point, but many of the devices that the movie opens saying have no power are working just fine and would 100% fail without the juice.
This was the argument I used in philosophy class to justify the torture and murder of puppies to create a chemical that makes chocolate taste better lol. I back the argument posed in the meme way more than what came out of my mouth, but philosophy class is boring if the entire class is in agreement. Lol
Years running a full security system?
Aye, but in a movie universe only what is shown exists and most generators require gas or need some source to last. In a newly bought house that hasn't had the power on neither would likely be on/working. They signed the contract seconds after the "no power" line.

Debatable, they take handprints at birth and have for a while, your finger print doesn't change EVER and it's available to governmental agencies online. That being said, few agencies have the computational power to crunch that out and animal control would be last on the list. CIA, FBI, NSA, any of them could find it with likely an hour process.
Lol, I was a small child and got picked on a lot, so I mixed some cayenne pepper, powdered red pepper, ash from the fireplace and put the concoction inside emptied quail egg's. To the top of this I added a thick layer of a hard coat black paint to seal it and protect it. Next time someone tried to whoop my ass I pulled it from the pouch I added into my grunge flannels, crushed it in my hand and calmly blew it into my assailant's face. When I got suspended for defending myself the headmaster declared, and I quote, "it Coulda been a gun, it Coulda been a knife..." No joke
^^because for the past few decades a war on civilians has been taking place preventing great research from being able to occur. Now that the obstacles are less senseless laws are no longer blocking research from being able to refute the wild claims that we have already proven to be false. Cannabis treats Cancer, it doesn't kill people, make them go insane, or even want to get violent, it never has been a gateway drug, nor likely much of what you have been told to believe. Under those circumstances I think skepticism in every other thing we've been told about the list of them would be considered an accurate policy.
Sounds like mommy's clone to me haha
By addictive qualities I mean it's a mental addiction, not a physical dependency issue. Plus who are any of us to speak of addiction, glued to Facebook and the interwebs like junkies one and all. We live in a society entirely of addiction, caffeine, working out, eating, praying, meditating, whatever it is, we are all addicts.
There are not addictive qualities to MDMA and the clinical applications of it have been documented from Shulgan first stumbling upon the compound to it becoming highly illegal (mainly due to the relative ease in which it could be made). In other words, another medicine that could benefit the people and be readily accessible to even those with little money has been shut down simply because any idiot with a steam distillation rig can effectively isolate everything they need from the same plant that creates root beer. Smell what I'm stepping in here?
It'll probably actually become a pleasant experience for those not liable to wet themselves :)

Makes life so much happier to have such a talent.
Their honey IS pretty good though :-/
^^ mean little fuckers too. An old rental of mine had an 8month old nest in the wall, I got stung on the eyelid while sitting on my back porch meditating. From meditation to searing pain for no damn reason. Evil bastards those killer bees are. Raid em all I say
I'm south of Washington now, in Oregon
Lol
I see you can makeup numbers too Scott ;)
Happy bday homeboy.
Couldn't tell ya, and they just hunted out the rates, the journalist didn't actually sell a kidney
Right, but that ain't the underground. Rich dying folks pay loads to bypass a list, at least the article I read seemed to indicate that. Kidney gets like 1/4 mil apparently. I really started to think about how bad I thought I needed one.
Like I keep saying, kidneys and children fetch a pretty price on the black market haha
I've been saying that for a while lol
Filed a lawsuit against my deadbeat landlord like a Viking.

Ladies, I need wake up photos of all of you now ;) lol
Pleasure my friend. :)
^^ if I wasn't in legal lands, I might be considering the same.
I couldn't agree more
I'm not gonna reveal much more of my build project, but I'll post pictures of the end result online... It's gonna look effin sick.
Stay tuned cause we have directors and producers in 4 states involved with the project, goal to be live within the next 3-4 months :)
I'm drooling a lottabit right now
I am selling off most of my things to get a .tv domain and build a computer (starting with 16gb of ddr4 ram)
Cause I can walk two blocks to the shady store down the way and get it. Mind you im in a part of town you lock doors always lol.
From a keg I presume, but how many other places can you do that in Atlanta?
Just use the long reed, all you need is a quick push into the dirt with a stick and drop it in
I'm a hippie duder, always plant the tree. You can't plant faster than douchebags can cut me down.
And weeping willows CAN get big, but often don't get terribly huge
Lol
Just pop em in the ground at a local park
Idk man, I can go into any convince store and pickup a growler of some heady local brewed suds, even kombucha from a keg at most places, as well. As far as beer goes in the states, I would have to agree that Oregon tops the list of what I've seen with only Alaska and the Dekotas left to visit.
It's very easy to clone most plants, once you learn the method. My fav is to root a bunch of Weeping Willow cuttings prior to making my clones. The cool thing about Willow is it produces the same b complex vitamins and hormones that cause rootings, they leave traces in the water after they have been pulled and planted so you have a free source cloning solution left over after. :)
Don't ever be sorry for being you and fuck the mother fucker up who expects you to be otherwise. Just sayin ;). Loves to you my dear.

True story: I was making a squib pack for an explosive bullet hit effect for an indie project I was working on. During the learning to build phase I had a date that I totally forgot about until I literally had to change and run out the door. It went well, till we came back to my place. Picture the scene entering my door with a white shirt and jeans, covered in stage blood next to what appeared to be a giant blood stain on the white carpet. I lost that date in 5 words, "It is a SFx project."
Aye, me too

The first person to throw a rock is likely an undercover cop or fed in ANY protest. They need some hippies to show em what's up. Push the stone thrower out ahead of the crowd towards the cops and block them from running back into your crowd.

Stand out of striking distance from the snake and stare it in the eyes till it backed down and left for less threatening hunting grounds. Almost set my backpack on one camping in Arizona before he let me know he was there. Good times
Hope a certain pedophile I know leaves the same way
A post saying "death to all cops" is hardly a threat. This is bullshit
"And we gave space for those that wish to destroy," direct quote from the retarded mayor. They rioted because she said that as a push to make them look like the racial slur one might expect of a bad stereotype rather than the proud and oppressed standing up for their right to live that they are. Media hype tactic to turn the tide against the protesters.
Wow
They already are with ladies sex toys ;)

Minds are like parachutes, they only function when open and clearly you are in danger of a hard landing
^^ well aren't you just a holier than thou spelling nazi that is too close minded to look past a grammatical error and possibly see some sense.
^^ lmfao this is rediculous and having money doesn't have fuckall to do with racism. Whoever put that stupid idea in your head makes a box of rocks looks smart. The bottom line is ANYONE can be racist, white, black, blue, green, yellow or whatever fucking color their skin. If you look at most racist groups, they are populated by broke ass rednecks who would certainly qualify for the "couldn't be racist cause they broke folk" approach. *facepalm*
The bottom line is the mayor caused all this by suggesting destruction in a clearly poorly thought out speech.

The hippie generation ended in the 60's, what we have now are a pretend variety who are really often little more than addicts and vagrants.
People need to stop mistaking druggies as hippies, the set of morality that came with the hippie generation died with it. We now only have people that like the drugs and pretend to follow he ideology.
Fuck Indiana quite throughly. This is just a shady tactic to make the public believe the local cops are actually getting more violent offenders than they actually are getting.

^^ if it's late night, I have seen officers walk into those type of all night establishments just to walk around and look at everyone and sit across the block waiting for them to get in their cars.

Therefore any decision we can come to could easily be slanted in either direction, regardless of if she is guilty of the crime or not.
Not enough context, we can ASSUME the blanks, but without the additional context it is not viable in court.
^^ again if the owner of the restaurant hadn't asked her to leave, the cop doesn't actually have the right to remove a patron from the premises (unless he is also the owner).
However if he was responding to something else and she talked shit and that is what resulted, she was drunk and exercising her right to free speech.
^^ probability
There is not enough in this video to make a decision either way. The cop is there already, clearly already talking to them before the phone is pulled out. If he got called because their was a complaint on them, she should have been arrested, if he pushed her for saying "fuck you," then technically he assaulted her to a minor degree and HE should be in cuffs. Too many unseen variables for a valid answer, end of story
Clearly not that local municipality, he WAS operating legally until they revoked his permit

In Arizona many properties have some sort of water harvesting or re-harvesting method and STILL needed city water. I'm betting one could go 100% off water grid out here, of course they wanna curb these ideas. He's an example to set for the next guy that thinks he'll break free of the machine.
The key words there are "in Oregon." Oregon of course being a pretty wet type of environment from what I can see. Not hard to be far more sustainable here.

Plus, if he cheats you should thank him. It lets you know before you go deeper into something that maybe you need to consider if it's worth it.
Armor up baby
Probably the same reason our screen breaks less?
However is far mor sustainable than assuming we have an unlimited supply at the turn of the wrist
Lol my phone service isn't good enough to load any of the pictures, I've been all written print.
Ok, now it loaded, again it still looks like he blocked his drainage pathways (standard rainwater harvesting practice) not the actual streams itself. Yes that would impact the water down stream by keeping the water on the land he paid for. In the end it looks like it's more an issue of the city deciding the legal permit they issued him would be better served if he had to buy his water THROUGH them.
^idk why but when I click your link it takes me back to the article I posted. Must be siri on crack again

Be local to Atlanta, is the first step, rail skinny (emaciated even) and willing to subject yourself to long, sometimes very uncomfortable days. Ga weather is freaking crazy, it's either 8000º too hot, really freaking cold (s2 finale was 25º during filming) etc. Best job EVER, if you're crazy enough to handle it. :-D

He is such a cool guy, I freaking love and miss him on set.
I was on from season 2 finale into season 4 and was most definately in the barn and breaking in from three sides, plus helping to eat Jimmy (too short to really get seen), shot by the fence AND in the group chasing after Andrea before she hid under the dead zombie.

I loved the s2 finale when they were driving around firing actual blanks at us. For an adrenaline junkie, having a gun leveled at you, fired and seeing the report is that moment of full adrenal surge as you fall "dead."

What is a cop's REAL job? To bring in revenue for the city. Considering I'm betting that there isn't a person alive who hasn't violated at least 1 law, knowingly or unknowingly, then it has been made literally impossible to live, without violations of 'laws.' Making the entire system designed for one thing, to take money from the citizens and re-appropriate it to uncle sam's wallet.
Yeah, but let's take a look at how the government is the largest proponent of armed robbery around. Pay them late after they sink their claws in you and you go to prison.
And I have friend only able to get their life saving treatments because of Obamacare. Frankly, my friend's lives matter more to me than most other things. Removing Obamacare assures they get no more treatments. It has done a LOT of good to those that I know. Remember it's the insurance companies that set their price, not the government. Yeah it's a flawed system, but if you had a pre-existing condition and couldn't get insurance, you would have an entirely different feel about he law.

Jessica, you'll get a laugh out of this one. I had a first date setup, but was working on a special effect for an indie film I was working on, the bullet hit effect. Basically, it's a tiny explosive pack (or ghetto rigged with a black cat), a condom full of slightly watered down fake blood and something solid to place between the skin and the explosive. In the process of making said effect, I had an incident an got a pool of fake blood on the white floor, had a bloody looking white shirt and pair of khakis next to it, bloody condom shreds in various places and THEN my alarm went off to meet my date. Long story short, the date wasn't bad, but she freaked the fuck out and bailed when we went back to my place for the nightcap. Poor girl's facebook post had to be something like "HOLY FUCK I ALMOST GOT MURDERED ON MY DATE TONIGHT." Was your that bad?
Because of a thing called compassion that all living beings should have. Lacking empathy is usually considered a bad thing, especially amongst circles who are extremely religious.

Scott summed it up nicely.
^^ heard her rev up the old vibe last night, from across the country.
Lmfao, while indeed quite humorous, it's clear by the cleaver use of a straw man defense and a penis joke that we've left the realm of intellectual debate.
Via whatever you buy with it, booze, inscense, candles, mood music/lighting/whatever.
Even with game, you ultimately open the wallet and share.
Beer money, jewelry money, gas money, grass money, impress her money. Just sayin, dating is usually a LOT more costly that a bag of grass, or the price of the container to grow it in.
Name one woman you didn't ultimately pay a LOT for.
^^ not justified per witness testimony. A testimony like that in a citizen "self-defense" trial would get you or I locked up for murder with intent.
Also Jaime, witnesses report no such thing as him driving at the cops, here is their testimony.

“They were standing behind the car, opening fire. He wasn’t driving towards them,” Goodyear customer Brittany Eustache told Channel 2 at the scene.

“The car was not moving when they began to shoot at him. The car had been stopped, he hit curb he could go any further,” she said.

“So at no point was he making any aggressive moves?” the reporter asked her.

“None, none at all. They immediately opened fire on them,” Eustache said.
Either way ALL police carry a taser. Idk if you've ever been hit by one, but they fucking hurt badly and will drop most people to the ground without further incident. Unarmed there is little to no reason to pull a gun over the non-lethal, end of story.

No, but we should change them to honor individual sovereignty and perhaps so being alive isn't illegal (which in itself would technically constitute entrapment).
Pretty sure you also wouldn't condone lynching a black man, or refusing him service because of the color of his skin. Without a little dissent and rebellion we would still have segregation. Slavery still exists, what else would you call paying a man less than a dollar an hour for a job in jail?
Alvin, there is likely no man or woman alive who has managed to live without violating at least one law unknowingly. In other words, of one cannot live without violating the law, then it is effectively illegal to live OR the law is corrupt and is designed to make it impossible NOT to violate the law, which would constitute a fucked up form of entrapment.
Alvin, you are plenty smart enough to know that all prohibition did the first time was give rise to organized crime. All it has done this next round is give rise to 'terrorist' organizations who fund their awful actions by selling what we make illegal right to us. In other words, it has given rise to far worse than organized criminals and you STILL think it's a good idea to continue the practice?

Jim, I may agree with that last statement, we should give Texas back to Mexico ;) seriously though dude if that is happening start looking for a new way to do it. Necessity breeds ingenuity.
Embrace change. If energy is your field, learn green energy and start your own business promoting it, it's a small step from where you are and one that could easily turn into you being the big boss if he giant company ;)
Jim ^^
The moral choice is the one that creates the greater good, which would be moving away from shitty energy practices and towards sustainable, green practices. Either way, not looking for new skills for when the inevitable happens and the green choice is made out of necessity is foolish, seriously start learning new things if you want to keep providing for your family.

^^ and I am in the process of destroying said sociopath. Grudges aren't bad if you pick the right battle.
"You passed. You are good and:

Positive

In a world full of increasing negativity, it's absolutely refreshing to find a positive, optimistic soul like yourself. You have an amazingly joyful and playful spirit, and you have an exceptional sense of humor. You got jokes like it's 1999, and it's always fun to be around you. You make life a bit wild, spicy, but extremely enjoyable. A scarce gem to find, you're truly a keeper and an amazing source of joy."
Holding a grudge doesn't make you a bad person necessarily. I hold grudges too, it just takes a while fucking lot to make that list. Ex. Bunny killing, rapist ex roomie, him I will see buried under the jail and will not rest till it happens.
^ the founding ideals are fabulous, the lazy morons who refuse to keep the rights that made this county are ALLOWING scum to hijack the traditions that once made us great and are replacing them with corrupt, capitalist 'morals' that leave a LOT to be desired.

^^ take a look Sara, tell me you think that is a normal slaughterhouse
http://bit.ly/17ufWlQ
http://bit.ly/17ufWlQ
In other words, I cannot stop that abuse, however THOSE animals acrually have meat on them. The animals I had rescued from the sociopath described had their rib cages touching. Aka nothing to eat on the animal because they were practically dead from starvation and dehydration prior to slaughter for 'food.' We're also talking about a man under investigation for raping his cousin at 14
It's not ok to torture the cow ether, I don't agree with the meat industry, however regulations say it is 'legal' and not abuse.
Nor do they serve guinea pigs in America, it's actually illegal to eat them.
^^ because the animals from the store aren't usually mistreated with starvation and deheydration prior to their slaughter, nor are they killed by choking, or being thrown against the wall. They probably don't get hung in the wall either.
^^ exactly
^^ because the prosecutor fucked up badly. It's his first big case and when the request to lower bail occurred, he didn't mention the three human victims that have come forward. #fail

Blue dream for me, but I'm celebrating an hour early
I think that overall police are morally and intellectually incapable of differentiating between a viable threat to their life and an innocent civilian. Therefore the corrupt and failed system should be dropped and a new one should take its place. That isn't to say ALL police, but he good ones should apply in the privatized security I would more readily embrace.
I have revised my comcast theory, they have gone above and beyond. Seriously it took 5 minutes to have my problem fixed from time of tweet.
Btw, use #XboxLive and those #chodes may have it pop up in their filter and #publicly #fix your #issue ;). Worked with #comcast ;)
Well played.
Lmfao
Not to say they haven't done their shootings too, however when protests happened, change happened.
I happen to be in the one state in America where the arrest rates haven't changed much in 100 years. Also the first state to embrace officers wearing cameras that go to a PUBLIC YouTube page. In other words, when I call the cops for help, they are publicly held accountable for their actions.
Oh most definately.
Plus there are the little things, like knowing which dispensary has freebies on which days. ;)
^^ the trials that we undergo all are there to teach us a lesson. Frankly I don't mind the rough to go with the good. For it is in the tough times that you REALLY find out who you are. Plus in a test of Darwin, no matter how bad you feel after, remember you won and are still alive ;)

I'm just saying if we can BOMB Iraq to shit from hundreds, even thousands of miles away (shock and awe), why couldn't we do the same to the truck convoy crossing hundreds of miles of open desert? Seems like an easy, no civilian's lost target if we REALLY wanted to get them. Considering Al-Queda was CIA trained and STILL gets checks from Israeli intelligence (again CIA created) I would presum this new 'enemy' is also a false-flag, operation Northwoods style group, also paid by the intelligence community.
Yay #debt.

What I see before me is a strong woman who has overcome many hardships and suffered many losses. From which many hard lessons have been learned, such as compassion, empathy, forgiveness and perhaps even a level of self confidence that wasn't preset before. I would say she is likely just as comfortable in the city as out playing in the mud and loving the feel of the grass between your toes, the sun on your face and an adventure to be had. Be weary as you work to make your inner light shine, darkness is attracted to light in an attempt to stamp it out. However if you trust to that inner voice that got you through your trials, sometimes you find from the darkness emerges new light, kindled by the beauty, passion and love you share with the world. Never forget sister, 'though art God' and as such create and master your own universe. We are each but guests in each other's worlds, one that becomes truly master of their world shall have no trouble when stepping into other's worlds.

I know people that have Halloween decorations up year round... ;)
I know you can read
They had private security to do the arresting
Lol, I find this an amazing idea that gives more back that a sealed box treated to withstand the elements and the natural process. Our problem is stepping away from it, this method gives back to the world that is our life support system. :) view it how you want, it's simply fantastic :)
Those night sticks are mighty long lol ;)
Aye, it is a damned shame that someone who swore to protect and serve the population and uphold the constitution to defend the people and do what's in the best interest of the majority is getting jailed for doing exactly what we pay him to do. Shedding light on the darkness again doesn't make it negative, it means that people have had enough of the bullshit. It would be negative to turn a blind eye and pretend that we don't do these things to people who don't deserve them.
Again, spreading awareness is hardly a negative, it is simply how real change can be effected. There is an undeniable problem with the system, pretending it doesn't exist has only made it worse. The only way to defeat the dark is by shedding light on it. ;)
I did not do these acts, merely am sharing the knowledge of their existence so hopefully we can break the doomed to repeat history mistake
Negative towards the police, again shared with hope that with knowledge comes the desire to effect a change. Currently I would vote with privatizing the policing of communities :)
How is it negative that crime went down through privatizing the policing of the community? That way the community gets EXACTLY what it pays for rather than the shady state of affairs we have now, proven to generate 61% higher arrest rates than necessary. :)
However a man of the cloth would be worried about where the soul went, an adventure we have had our lives to cope with. Death holds no fear or negativity for me, it is the one thing we are assured upon entering this world and is the price we pay for admittance.
Depends on how you view it. As I am a man of science, my mind is eased in the knowledge that I live on after my mortal skin is shed because energy can neither be created nor destroyed, merely changed. Humans generate electricity at our core, so thus absolutely qualify as beings of energy. :)

Oh believe me, it was and is my pleasure to see a sociopath like this behind bars. From my understanding there have been a lot of calls to the animal control, enough so they have a sherif working with them now. I do not believe his wrap sheet is finished by a long shot.
Scott, you realize there have been 5 in the 2.4 billion year history of the earth you last ice age being 2 billion years ago is impossible.
I bite oh so delightfully too ;)
Hommie, geologists have studied underground lakes that prove that there is a 20 year warming period which is the onset of an ice age. After that warming period, it goes cold, very, very cold. All you are saying is the scientists are correct that it is warming, which is also saying so far scientists are correct about the onset, as well. With as much seismic activity as we've had recently we can assume that more is coming. One plate moving sets off not just Yellowstone but ALL super volcanos on the planet. How is it a far stretch to presume this is not just possible, but a likely outcome considering ice ages are a regularly occurring thing with little deviation to their onset or duration and is being AT that time.
Group: WEIR HERE LISTENING PARTY
Pick me pick me^^
Scott, just because you don't take the time to understand something doesn't make it any less true. It just means you have chosen the bliss side of the ignorance = bliss equation. I assure you, bliss won't keep you warm during an ice age, but the books I own and read on matters such as this sure as hell will keep me warm. Just sayin.
Actually Scott, what happens for us to enter an ice age is merely a 4° shift of the Earth's axis. Bear in mind that tectonic activity such as the quakes in Haiti and Japan change our tilt a bit. Those two quakes alone got about a .25° shift, to give a little perspective. What will likely end us (and the ENTIRE United States, plus parts of Canada and Mexico) is Yellowstone erupting. The picture below shows the range of blow from previous eruptions. If you think you are safely out of range in the other states you are right... And wrong. Sure the lava won't reach you, but the 1-10 feet of 2000° ash falling on top of you will likely make for a ad day. The ash blasted into the atmosphere will block out the sun long enough to cause some serious problems temperature wise and lord only knows how big a shift that could create. Perhaps big enough to reverse the poles (which also happens on this magic rock flying through the universe).
Group: WEIR HERE LISTENING PARTY
I like your style :)
Just gonna leave this here, please note the last line of the second paragraph. Ice ages come on like clockwork, we are overdue for the freeze period already. Meaning we are likely in the temperature rise that leads to the deep freeze as we speak.

If you can bring it intellectually I'm in to learn something new. If not, perhaps you would be in for some learning. :)

Yeah, me too. Global warming MAY not in fact be a thing, merely a symptom of the impending ice age. The earth undergoes a 20 year period of warming before the deep freeze. Once it hits, it's overnight though. Yay artic temps world wide. :)

No, I said he had not been arrested and was not behind bars, that changed friday apparently.
^^ bingo.
Yes, this is him. Thank you, I can breathe so much easier now that he is behind bars.
^^ just the tip of the iceberg, notice how he doesn't even bat an eye, look ashamed, guilty, remorseful, any of it. More developments to come, I assure you.

I wouldn't go that far, finding food off the land is really very difficult and those not practiced WILL go hungry. The problem then becomes where does your food come from, likely an abandoned store, car, etc. The same place everyone else is looking for food too. Your worst enemy is someone hungrier than you.

Here, we're going to give you some AWFUL nightmares, trauma, flashbacks and then NOT give you any of the assistance that you were promised when you signed up, then 'thank' you for your service with jail time when the issues we created cause you to not be able to survive in the real world, outside of the military machine. Once you are homeless, good luck, you're just a statistic to drive up the arrest rates so the cops look like they actually catch crimanls. You know as well as I do that many, if not most major crimes don't actually get a conviction. If they did, then the prison population wouldn't be 3/4 non-violent offenders (you know the ones that it makes SENSE to keep separated from society because of their crimes AGAINST society rather than just crimes to their own self (source cited)). The bottom line is all the cops that "feared for their lives" are fucking immoral cowards that chose to shoot before even thinking or evaluating. These are men and women so torn my their cowardice they pretend they have a really dangerous job, but that simply isn't true, being a police officer didn't even make the to 10, fishing is more dangerous than being a cop. Of COURSE they "fear for their life," because they are terrified BY life. A job that carries that level of power over others and NEED for a group to be able to function is typically considered a gang. In fact the legal definition of a gang is "a group of three or more that regularly meet and engage in criminal behavior." EVERY one of the police issues that result in paid leave are CRIMINAL acts that would put anyone else in jail. By legal definition, the police are an unlawful gang that has risen to far more power than they should have. The constitution was written to TAKE power from the government and GIVE power to the people. Our founding fathers would be rolling over in their graves and looking down on us with disgust at the level of greed and stupidity we have allowed control over us. The first revolutionary war was fought to defend the people from a tyranical threat that was attempting to ensure that we would ALWAYS be in debt to them and thus would never truly be free. We have again embraced that system with a carefully orchestrated crash of the economy and abolishing the gold standard (the only thing that gave our $$ actual VALUE). The bottom line is we are rapidly moving in the same direction and WHEN the government outlaws such currency as bitcoin and the like, we will have the exact same conditions that created the first, mark my words, the revolutionary war isn't over, there WILL be a second one just as soon as the government chooses to do EXACTLY what started the revolutionary war in the first place, put a ban on money being created by anyone BUT the bank that it comes from as a loan.

Make her cum harder and more than she ever has, biologically speaking women release oxytocin at the moment of orgasm. The best move you could possibly make to have her fall in love with you is to study Tantra and read a book called "The Multi-orgasmic male." Trust me, you and any lady you are with after will thank you for taking the time.
Holy crap, I'm so sorry this happened to yall. Reki heading your way.
We passed it on the way to your area.
basic psychology. We all have what's called ego, those that want us, we don't need because they come to us. Those that ignore us, we want because "what is wrong with me that....." Love comes hand in hand with hurt, you cannot have one without the other. Why because we ALL get hurt sometimes, we all have bad days and we all say things we don't mean when we are upset. To be truly happy you ignore all that bullshit and look to which there were more of, happy moments or unhappy.

Last I heard she had left the place that I took her to and had been staying in an abandoned house for a minute. When it got freezing cold she went back to a crisis center. It could be that she had too many voluntary "i might kill myself" admittances to the hospital and they are keeping her longer than the 72 hour watch. (my deepest hope :-/ )
I do not, I haven't spoken with her since I dropped her off, I'm kinda the asshole that carries the blame for her situation, even though it was David who did EVERYTHING except man up and take care of the situation himself. If you DO hear from her, let her know I'm really sorry it had to be me and even if she isn't getting bean and whatsit back, they at least are no longer starving in the dark attic. I did the best I could in a fucked up situation and got paid back by getting tossed into the street myself. At least I managed to save her dogs from starving, locked in a cage in the dark attic.
Get me there and you're on :0

Cop tazes MY kid he won't make it to the station to file the report
buddy of mine got them regularly, he stayed out of the hospital and just bought a 30 rack of beer and peed into a fine strainer till the stone popped out. He has gotten 3+ stones a year since he was 15 and has tried everything. His report is the beer makes all the pee happen and the drunk makes the pain stop. Just a thought hommie, go get redneck blasted and see what happens ;)
too adorable
Last I heard she was in another hospital (the only safe place I could find her instead of the streets). I really did everything in my power to make sure she would at least have a place to be before I left. If she had contacted me, I could have done more. Sadly, it turned out I took the wrong one to the mental hospital.
human nature would involve something natural, a cop being behind you is a 'nature' we prescribed to ourselves, making it far from 'human nature.'
"justice" system... RIIIIIIGHT
^^ cop saying that you would get killed for the same action.
Not bashing cops, I'm bashing the laws that allow bad cops to keep their job, murder innocent people, not pay for the crimes THEY commit and allows them to walk around with a feeling of superiority. You said it best as a cop, YOU get nervous when a cop gets behind you. The gang should NOT be afraid of it's own members, then it is no better than ANY other gang. Like all other forms of organized crime, cops cannot do anything without 9 other badges present. It's cowardice when gang members have to have 9 on one, it's the same shit when you have 9 gun wielding, possible sociopaths intimidating someone and taking their money or their life at the point of a gun. The law is the largest proponent of armed robbery out there and that needs to change if Uncle Sam thinks that folks will continue to pay their paycheck when 'serve and protect' is nothing but a fancy reach around while getting fucked by the long black dick of the law.
Someone is just a little hurting for some lovin, dude got the wrong two fingers up to make a really intense orgasm happen.

I was told by Williferd to serve Francine with the three day eviction notice he had already prepared. As there was legal documentation etc and hommie insisted that take place, I did what had to be done as the situation at the house was WAY out of control.
One of those had to fall in the 8 hours of death, the cop probably "feared for his life" and shot one of the other two.

It is horribly irresponsible gun ownership and use. Anyone 'trained' with a weapon would say the same. Any one of those 600 bullets could have EASILY struck and killed someone well off scene and 200% innocent. You or I would go to prison as a dangerous criminal for such reckless abandon with proper gun safety. It's appalling they call themselves 'trained.' If they had ANY training, they would regret ever having to pull it and reach for non-leathal measures first.

No, but if he had done his job and taken a pretty crooked person to jail then he wouldn't have had the chance to steal my shit Alvin. As his job is to take criminals to jail, he failed to do the job he's paid for.

Only because we have failed them by allowing the ruling powers to herd us into agreeing to asinine policies with little time to fight back.
Cops aren't needed NOR wanted until they are called.
actually the rights violating started at the bar and continued through the rest of the interaction. Just being AT the bar doesn't give enough probable cause to expect drunk driving. There are many things that can be ordered at a bar that don't include alcohol, in fact some of my friends who are no longer alcoholic find it helps them to remember why they stay sober to see all the idiots in their cups. They sure aren't driving drunk and by the same "logic" that Doree was driving drunk would also be stopped and harassed.
and using intimidation tactics to get someone to say yes also qualifies.
Doree would actually be correct here. As she was within the legal limit his entire interaction after that was a violation of her rights. The only crime he COULD have expected her to be committing at that time was DUI, when that came back negative his probable cause ended as did his right to push any further unless you're telling me the constitution is a piece of toilet paper to the police force.
lmfao, i needed that this am
It's like all repressed cultures get, loud and less and less liable to sit and watch rather than scream back and take things to extremes as balance is sought.
that is the problem

EVEN as one of the gang
serve and protect shouldn't equate to getting fearful

http://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836
I can site an article for my claim as well
They also need to have a damned physical and allow higher IQ folks to enter the force
Cops should be more like firemen and EMT's, stationary (read working out) until called into action. They would be more likely to retain those that are one the side of good and less likely to attract those that have something to compensate for.
DUI checkpoints are quasi-legal too, more grey area shit
and unconstitutional to boot
If it isn't entrapment, it's about as grey area as it gets
The judge that put me in jail was apparently well known by a meth cook that I met while locked up that worked for him. The cook sadly got busted on his way to spend time at a casino in a different county so buh bye. The cops my ex wife called after her ex hit her and kicked her car didn't arrive saying "we can't do anything for you." When I got robbed, they didn't even come to take a police report. This is literally the first time in my 30 years I have received the help i needed from an officer and i STILL did not get all my animals back, one has been over there for another 48 hours because they wouldn't stay any longer and since he is NOT in jail for the crimes he committed, it's kinda not safe for me to get any of my things. tried to spin by yesterday to call for my cat and EVERYONE who was involved in making threats against me was there. They DID help, but they do I believe that they preformed the job I paid them for? Absolutely not.
They are the largest proponents of robbery at gunpoint. Resist the robbery and they aren't going to get in trouble for it. All it is is a way to separate the slaves from the money the machine so desperately needs so it can keep us all enslaved.

although Gacy Jr is NOT in jail after slaughtering 6 rabbits and having the warrant served covered in their blood.

Alvin, you also happen to know I agree with Thorne
I just wish the cops had rolled yesterday when I was working with them to get the warrant, ALL the rabbits would have been saved. Glad we got there when we did and at least saved some of them.
Gacy Jr isn't in jail, no way anyone knows where I'm at, but it's been a crazy week. I'm just sad I wasn't able to save more of them. I tried to get them to roll yesterday, BEFORE he slaughtered them
5 of those deaths were in the past 3 weeks
2 months, didn't go downstairs for my first month though. Didn't actually look in the cage in the back yard until I saw a rabbit starved to death.
not sure why the sheriff didn't take him in, his sister talked his way out I suppose

Sadly they aren't out of the woods yet Sonia.

They are still currently in harm's way, however if they are hurt in any way it will be MUUUUCH worse for him.

At first it seemed like a good place, the price was right, as was a lot else. However, it ended up as a VERY different story and obviously so half way through last month. Like Mundy's dumb ass, I stated innocently collecting bits here and there so I could defend myself if backed into a corner. Last night I was backed into a corner, threatened, had a car following me through 8 random turns, then made my 9th turn coming head on at me as I hoped he would and know exactly who it was, one of the abusive pigs friends.
Love you too Doree, this has been a crazy 24 hours, I have slipped two tails, identified one of them by tricking him into having to drive at me from in front of me, clear shot of his face, been threatened with a car full of guys with baseball bats, filled two police reports and am now hiding safely in a hotel out of harms way until after silver bracelets have been placed on ;)
Warrant gets served in the am
Thank you folks, not out of the woods yet.
No more yall Howie, she's gone
Psh, already out at the ass crack of dawn to fill out police reports and setup to take this house of cards down. I am safely hidden, out of town, having lost the tail that tried to follow me. Who needs movies with a life as exciting as mine :p
Congrats
Lol, that test is so far from accurate it's incredible. Steven Hawking is 160, just saying you ain't figuring out the astrophysics behind black holes.
Don't thank me yet, the buerocratic system is being slow with the warrant. Today looks as if it may be a hopeful estimate, the officer is typing up the paperwork as fast as her little fingers can fly.
Lol, that may yet happen, we shall see
Iris, Elisabeth and I took a split, I am flying solo.
so i DID still mispeak technically
however rabbits are no longer considered rodents, but a different family and have that same trait
^^ this
My b, they have been changed to Lagomorpha rather than Rodentia, they are no longer rodents apparently
i think, pretty sure their teeth don't stop growing either
Brandy, ever eatten rabbit? it's a rodent ;)
I'm golden darlin, thank you.
I am in a safe location and after the threats of violence I received last night will be hiding out as this gets resolved.
It does not, it does however have to do with protecting what I put everything I had into making for myself.
I wasn't ready to fire details, which have since been release in a separate post and album.
Human consumption, although with the level of disease that has been running through them, probably just to litter the lawn
The rodents were purchased as "pets" but intended for food, they are being saved from slaughter today.
the post explaining my edit in case you couldn't find it...

"Ahh the joys of seeing a well laid plan executed perfectly. Thank you all for all the well wishes last night, it means a lot in the fucked up world I am in. However my post last night was primarily to cover me gathering the evidence I need to protect and defend myself in this situation. Police have been involved and measures have been taken to ensure my safety after a threat of violence to relinquish my legal right to my place to live and to protect the many innocent animals being starved and denied proper medical care when they are sick, I have witnessed 4 deaths in my stay. Yall were perfect to cover my photographic evidence being gathered to bring this shit to an end. Congratulations, through your efforts what's left of ~20 rabbits and guinea pigs, plus the two little dogs locked in the attic will be saved from the 48+ hours they have had with no food and water or longer will receive the care and attention they need and deserve. Give yourselves a hand for helping me play bawling mess over a breakup while I continued to gather evidence of mistreatment. :)"
however you would be welcome to pm me Caroline
^^ the level of this shit storm I am preparing to surf tomorrow is beyond that of any I have ever faced, it's really depressing and just ridiculously drawn out and intricate and once that kettle of worms opens it's 900000000000 question I don't feel like answering. publically :p
Doree, you have no idea the ridiculous shit storm in my life right now
as per justified for a breakup
I took my two days
So super smexy, miss you.
The posters never showed up and they were supposed to mail them out
Oh shit, so basically they never followed through with the bonus for the ticket costs. When do refunds go out?
So, I never got either of the two signed Alex Grey posters I paid for with my two VIP tickets, what gives?
Auquaponics rocks, Yall are behind the times of you don't know this one
Had a freakin blastola look forward to coming back out to hang again soon.

Aka the last officer taking me to jail admitting in her cruiser that she knew I had violated no laws. Big oops with a camera in the car.
That we live in a police state and I have witnessed first hand the lack of "justice" held in the just-us department having been arrested and convicted of a DUI 0.00, which have enough probable cause for a warranted blood and urine test, aka handcuffed to a bed and given a catheter and stuck with a needle, sans consent.
Brother don't I know the feeling, saw my kid for the first time in three years on the trip out west all cause it's not kidnapping for mommy to bail state without notifying me
So I heard a buddy at a party scream "pikachu I choose you," a few seconds pass where I presume he preformed a Philly Fake Out (Google it ;) ) followed by her scream and him roaring over her "squirtle sneak attack."
Miss you too Kevin, I tend to use my devious inner prankster to egg such forces on :p
Supposedly the film crew got a door knob turning and a dog barking in an empty hotel. Or so sayeth the front desk guy who is two days into a new job.
Basic point is it should be legal across the board, the only reason it isn't is because of greed for money.
^^ Terri, that made like 0 sense. It is not an ecig, therefore it cannot cut into any use of an ecig. It is designed and sold for medical cannabus patients and the only issues that a regular pothead will cause with it is an issue of the munchies or a night in the clink for using the safest recreational substance we have. In other words the only issues with it will be caused by people who are imposing their insane and inaccurate beliefs on others for profit.
please do :-D

Hell to the no, I vote anarchy and the abolishment of ALL police. We need to return to a communal living situation where we work to MAKE LOCALLY all the food we need for the community. No need for money when a simple trade of services works. Crime will be easy to spot, "we don't know him, what's he doing in our community?" Without drastic measures arguing over police is a moot point compared to "oh shit we destroyed our host planet past our survivability."
^^ beef tongue Emily, not pig.
Carla if that was supposed to convince me its a bad idea, it did the opposite. Now I GOTTA see what happens :p
Carla, not if I tricked you into just he first bite, you'd be taste hooked before you knew what it was ;)
And let me tell you, Elisabeth is an UBER picky eater and scarfed her half with no hesitation after the first bite :)
Carla, can't knock it if you haven't tried it. :)
^^ depends on the source, cow brains are risky the rest are not. The issue there is we were feeding cows other cows, brain and all, to fatten them up. Prion issues come from consuming the brain of you own species, other such farm animals didn't suffer the same fate and now we know so are sill safe to eat.
Sheep or lamb brains are safe and freakin delicious. I really dig smoking Em and tossing them on pizza.
EVERYONE has to worry about what that police officer behind them wants and will do if they've had a bad day and need someone to take it out on.
getting hacked by anonymous that is ;)
Alvin, only someone truly aligned with a soulless beast such as the government, big pharma, law enforcement in citieis where murdering unarmed children is a paid vacation and likely unsustainable corporations would have to worry about that.

Which is FAR worse than ibogaine, let's treat an addiction by changing it to a new addiction, or plan the easy mode quit (minus withdrawal and go suboxin. Ibogaine has addiction breaking properties, of the three methods it makes the most sense.
PS. "The odds of dying in a pane crash are equal to that of being hit by lightning 7 times." I believe that means that again your sources are far from accurate.

Beard, to be statistically correct there have been only 28 lightning related deaths this year and a HELL of a lot more shootings or killings, my first piece of evidence sites what the author could find for the year of 2011, as you can see in California alone you are ~3.6x more likely to die by cop shooting (not including beatings) than by lightning strike and then you bring in the rest of the states... Just gonna say your sources are about as factual as anything Nancy Grave has ever said. (the second link will be the current count of lightning strike deaths countrywide)

those plants are Thai, tis one of the ancient strains. As in it's 100% as it was found in the wild, having gotten it's genetics from entirely landrace lineage. You may not be surprised to find that the plant was originally found growing in Thailand (hence the name).

^cool duder
^^ what he said
Considering I have been making the style of hash I will be selling for 12 years (yes concentrates have been around a long time, no BHO is not a new technique), and have extensive experience in cannabis cultivation, yeah pretty sure I'm a good pick. Also it means they have more plants to use and distribute just as soon as I find a place to toss my equipment and set up my grow :). (Disclaimer: I am a legal MMJ patient and per Washington state law allowed to grow up to 15 plants)
I would be a legally operating, medical hash and concentrates vendor. Basically sell hash to dispensaries, sounds terrible, right?
It's a job I am uniquely qualified for and will likely result in LOTS of amazing times had.
We want to legally steal your legally gotten drug money, but drugs are WAY bad, mmmmkay.
Lol, the point isn't that, the point is that a normal traffic stop doesn't need to be taken to the extreme level of warrantless searching of private property, which is a constitutional violation regardless of that. A right that is getting bullied away and that we should absolutely stand up for if we are to believe that due process is a fair system (innocent until proven guilty). In many cases, and my past included, it was a warrantless search that found me guilty of smoking a harmless plant two days prior to driving (I blew a 0.00 and went to prison). After getting out for the terrible crime of being sober while driving. I get out of jail to find my house having been ransacked (literally everything dumped on the floor), convicted to earn 7 years of having to sign for a felony on every application (little ability to get a decent job). Do you think I deserved to be in prison for a two day old joint in my system after blowing a 0.00?
^^ your jolly troop of buddies has not and is not a normal experience in much of America. I have first hand witnessed horrible violations of civil law in detaining innocent people in a harassing manner. Often it gets worse when you get small town, why? Because the police have little real crime to go after (that they have much hope of figuring out or are wiling to), so they have to justify their budgetary needs to the state somehow. I tend to find forces with the nicest cars are the most corrupt. What experience have I you ask? I now have three states I haven't driven through and or fucked around in for extended bits, you can imagine I've met a lot of police in my day, across the country. If your band of boys isn't corrupt and mostly catching spenders and those not harming anyone (quiet user who dutifully works and takes care of all public needs, but does X, Y, and maybe Z to relax at the end of the day) over getting out and doing the hard work necessary to catch the robbers, rapists, and violent offenders instead, then kudos. But as I remember you quit for reasons in line with what we're saying. If a cop isn't dirty, then having cameras posting to public domain while on duty shouldn't be a problem. This of course is only an invasion when they are on a citizen fronted paycheck and are bound by oath to both serve and protect those of us who cannot do so for ourselves. The end of driving up arrest rates to justify outrageous budgetary needs needs to also happen, simple as that. Cops have more power than they should with little to no public accountability, the masses will believe any lie put widespread enough on the idiot box.
I'm happy to see you :)
A pretty pimpin card game. You take control over a family and play cards to reduce their self-worth so you can kill them. You can play cards on your opponents family to cheer em up, it's kinda a blast

^^I think it's more likely that most will kill each other off in desperation for the bounty held at stores
And only to the Muslim EXTREMISTS, who are little different than Christian Extremists, they both kill and torture that which is different (tell me Christian's don't do that still and I'll list thousands of hate crimes against homosexual men and women in this country). The point is both parties are zealot run and media fed, also after Operation Northwoods (http://bit.ly/1sImqS9) was suggested, we cannot trust that the "terrorist" attacks haven't been perpetrated by a government thirsty for the profits and spoils of war.
http://bit.ly/1sImqS9
Alvin, to be fair the Christians don't want to kill me ANYMORE. It wasn't all that long ago they burned heathens at the stake in this country.
the joys of being a public figure I suppose lol

yeah, that place is badass, i really wanna go.
In the current system we have no choice but to play into it, or are you suggesting the Phoenix approach?
I'll do more than that baby, rawer.
Christians still are blinded by their literally insane belief of an invisible man watching your every move actually existing. Issue #1, anyone intentionally trying to keep you ignorant is taking advantage of you in some way (go ahead an find a case of someone trying to keep you from knowledge that isn't for personal gain). Issue #2, for a 'supreme' being he sure is awfully insecure which is far from 'perfection' unless we are supposed to be violently angry over someone not showing us respect. The bottom line is arguing over a storybook character that has gotten far too real is crazy in light of us factually killing what factually does everything God is described as doing while creating chasms between the peoples. Religion was intended for one thing, to teach love to the masses, so far all civilization has gotten from it is an excuse to kill those that look, believe, behave or are different. Its a failed experiment into our psyche, nothing more.
And the sign reads cannabis, not THC :)
Edward, not sure what sort of history you've read, but Jesus's teachings may be peaceful but his followers never have been. In fact his followers have been slaughtering Muhammeds followers for about all of religion's sordid 2000 year old history of denying the factual reality of where our source of life is. A hint for you, look down not up. These dolts arguing over an invisible man in the sky are brining about the ruin of our planet in their selfish greed, all while many of us trapped on the same boat as them wish we could just knock some sense into them, problem is they are too stupid to see that fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity, it just doesn't work.

Still a whopping 580+ difference between citizens killed and police killed. In other words, it's more dangerous to be the citizen than the police officer in ANY stop. My statistics are closer to on than you want to think Alvin

^^ right but as a war against the citizens has clearly been started with police now having weapons of war and mercs freshly made in an illegal war, it had to start somewhere.
Looting stores is always awful, however having been in many protests, I've found that the person that starts throwing rocks tends to vanish behind police lines just as soon as idiots in mass follow along.
Also, rioting isn't anarchy.
Anarchy is STILL a more efficient system, just ask Acapulco. They have been cop free (all police on strike) for a few months now. You can take you lack of hearing about it as a sign it's still going well. ;)

In the case of Ferguson, people who have targets painted on them are rioting because they are tired of being picked on by a government who INTENTIONALLY keeps them where they are by not funding the schools in the poorer, predominately minority areas. We have established a minimum wage living is NOT one that someone can survive on, yet ALL minimum wage jobs i've ever had penalized me for picking up a second job so I COULD survive. Those being the circumstances and 100% not being able to get a better job without education, or even a secondary education without a decent starting education, 2000% the rich white fucks "looking out for the citizens welfare' that are responsible for these shenanigans.

And in full support of those in ferguson rioting over the black child(ish) murdered by the police. The level of violence perpetrated on protestors who WERE being peaceful until the just-us system failed again. White people riot over stupid shit like sports and allow things like the patriot act to pass into action without much fight.

Yall are dumb, if more citizens carried guns and were trained in the safe use of firearms, especially in situations of duress the untrained assailant would be put down with merely 3 shots fired, two of them by the gym teacher saving the rest of the students. Stop playing into the propaganda machine taking away our right to bear arms, the cops take 30+ minutes to arrive, do you wanna wait an hour for someone to save you when the time comes, or would you prefer the 30 second toss magazine into the gun, cock and defend your family. The wait will leave you helpless till they get there.

^^ if you had been taught safe gun use practices from an early age, you would feel it as an extension of your hand.
Plus cops should be tried for criminal offences as soon as they violate a citizen's civil rights, again their job is to UPHOLD the law, not break it.
giggity
I'm quite thankful they have the backs of the protestors, I have seen very violent unprovoked attacks by the police while holding a sign to end war. Indy media is busting the gestapo regime wide open with insider video footage. Let's face it, the indoctrination system Hitler used to rise to power is the same propaganda machine used to blind the population into manipulation, mass media. However Indy media is becoming more mainstream and readily available through the Internet. Probably why police are getting more sweat, everyone has a video camera and is liable to pull it out. Shitty practices are caught on picture or video more often and easier to share. It's not that these incidents have risen, merely that they are more often caught on video. I 20000% support Anonymous in policing the police, especially the racist pigs in Ferguson, attacking peaceful protestors unprovoked.
And those responsible for UPHOLDING the law should 20000% not be violating the constitution they are sworn to uphold. This action is a small step from checking unlocked cars for a "scent" and waiting to make another criminal out of someone harming no one but themselves. Drive up the outrageous sentences for the infraction and our prisons will continue to overflow. If this is a "free" country there shouldn't be more incarcerated than China (about the most oppressive government around).
Hehe, had a blastola
Adorable
Lmfao, glad to do my part to assit in the boost up the social ladder lol.
Now if the door was left open, the cop could legally enter the premises, without that it's just an unlawful search of the car.
^^ Alvin, you would be incorrect, the door closed and no one around indicates that there is no permission to enter private property, aka police are REQUIRED by law to have a warrant to enter the private property, as per our 4th amendment right

Probability, like much in America, once it's started it becomes uber hard to stop
Frankly, I'm betting like the Taliban (who take an Israeli intelligence paycheck), ISIS is an imaginary threat in the tradition of Operation Northwoods (http://bit.ly/1sImqS9) which I'm positive the Bush administration would endorse since their family stood so much to gain by faking an attack on American soil. Considering the Bush family and the Bin Laden family together make up the majority shareholders of the company that produced our weapons for war, the billions gained add up to enough motive to beyond reasonable doubt convict ANYONE else of the crime (undeniable motive).

Only type 1 diabetes requires (100% no fail) all the checks, etc, all other types of diabetes can be managed with a simple dietary change. I know more than a few people that never do checks or need the shots because they switched their diet to manage their diabetes.

ummmm, then 2000000% report it, they'll settle out of court. First thing you say when they broach that, "your offer better have enough zeros to make my jaw drop or we're going through the media frenzy that will be a sexual harassment lawsuit, are you prepared for that?"
Wish it would, all Fox reporters are more guilty of lying to the public than any politician. Fucking wastes of space and our precious oxygen.
congrats
They should be more than willing with just your request for legal reasons, if not ask where to have your lawyer send the subpoena for the information.
Call legal council and see what they can do to help you. A sexual harassment lawsuit usually nets big money (ensure the person AND the business are being sued). As such, you should be able to find a contingency fee lawyer without problem (should you actually have a case). I would go ahead and send a request to facebook to have those records returned and or printed, emailed, whatever.
The court can absolutely subpoena to have those records released and deleting cause your mom is looking should have ended in highschool. Pretty sure she knows you've had sex and like men, she can get over you talking to men, its what you're supposed to do as a heterosexual adult.
cause if you dont and fast, you have legally consented.
are you going to file the complaint?
Well then don't complain for you are consenting to his harassment, just saying.
honey, your silence is what allows him to keep doing this to girls in the future. Every woman hurt in the same way will be on your hands as you could have acted to put a stop to it. The same is true of "rape" (i put rape in quotations because failing to turn the person in or file a report DOES count as consent in court, regardless of if it was actual rape).
Also, please feel free to share this status. This is more for the reach of the post and the effect that it will have on the #Dodge brand. The more it's passed around, the more likely they want me to pull said post and put some glowing review of thanks for the new car, cash back, etc. Frankly, I'm calling a lawyer and suing them for the full price of the car so I can replace it with a car from another manufacturer that will be less likely to screw me and have a more dependable vehicles for sale.
in other words, the bible is wrong
if we widely accept that we are beings of energy and scientific law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, merely changed (law of conservation of energy), then of course we don't just go to some invisible castle in the sky for eternity, for we never really die, just change forms.
it's called sexual harassment and is illegal. Complaining doesn't fix the situation, action does.
so call a lawyer and sue his bitch ass

^^ but that is simply not true
including the way we "enforce" it. The bottom line is that there are more than a few innocent people behind bars, probably hundreds of thousands (considering our outrageous incarceration numbers). Why? because police get a bit to gung-ho to lock folks up. Police have caused the overpopulation of our prisons by continuing to blindly follow laws that many of them probably disagree with.
not saying all are bad, nor that the police officer calling me a friend is bad, merely the system is flawed and needs to change.
Police are far from the least of my worries, in fact they top the list usually. Flashing blues are a great way to ruin a day and extort a citizen
The police officer that tossed me into my car hood after blowing a 0.00 wasn't enforcing ANY laws, just being a douchebag.
You've seen me all sugar high at CEDU, coke and sugar do the exact same thing to the brain in slightly varying degrees
cause they already DO control both you and me, the police are the weapon used to enact such control
Then get your buddies on the force to stand up and do some protecting and serving as patriots to our founding ideals, with a little dissent.
Hitler just used movies for obvious reason, but the point is film was how he pulled the wool over the German population's eyes to create the terrible regime that followed.
OUr government uses the same tactics Hitler did, mass media propaganda and agenda setting through television, movies, etc.
for a free country we certainly have a lot of people locked up, most of them for non-violent crimes. This indicates that the punishment does not fit the crime, especially the people locked up for the medical disease of addiction. The police are at fault because they sure as fuck COULD opt to choose to do the job they are paid and stand up for the people paying them to protect them and serve them. Isn't that what their job is SUPPOSED to be? In a country where we have the right to bear arms to protect from threats both domestic and foreign (yes we constitutionally have the right to overthrow the government, violently if we have to), those given guns to protect should be the ones first standing up.
and both need to be held accountable
Both

As one who went to prison for DUI after blowing a 0.00, i know EXACTLY how much "justice" the justice system holds. For my crime of being sober while driving they were bent on giving me 2.5 years of time, without standing before the court and turning on the best acting ability I had to claim how wrong I was, sorry for being sober while driving and accepting of my punishment was the only way out of the 2.5 year sentence. While IN prison, I met a guy who robbed 4 banks at gunpoint, sentenced to 2.5 years. The system is fucked and has no justice in reality. Let's face it, the probability is that most of the "murderers" in bars are just the unfortunate fool that bought the murder weapon and got caught doing something stupid (devils advocate here, but if i shot/stabbed/etc someone, I would sure as fuck sell/toss the weapon). Police need to get back to their REAL job, protecting and serving, not harassing and condemning everyone. The quota system that is illegal and still heavily suggested that officers meet needs to end, driving up "arrest" rates to make up for the crimes with victims that never get solved is counter-productive. The bottom line is police no longer do the job they are paid for a majority of the time.
it's to protect the country from Domestic terrorists such as myself that stood up with signs that said "make love, not war," "no more oil war," "know justice, know peace," and a plethora of other such monikers. OMG, it's a hippy, take away it's rights and spy on it, one day we shall burn it at the stake

You do not have permission to disarm me, and I do not censent to any searches or seizures of my person or propery, including a pat down as outlined in Terry v. Ohio. I will not answer any questions without an attorney present. Any statement or actions I make henceforth will be made under duress and threat of force against me by an armed Officer of the law. If you have reasonable articulable suspicion that I have committed, about to commit, or in the process of committing a crime, please provide such reasonable suspicion and the code and name of the crime of which I am being accused. If you cannot or will not provide such suspicion or provide the legal code section for the alleged offense you claim to be investigating, I would like to be free to go on my way, or you will then be declared to be in violation of my civil rights, and punitive damages will be sought against you and your department. "
yup, bitchslap that officer around and call him Suzy. You laid that bitch out.

"No matter how she behaves." Sorry, but that's not how life works, and unacceptable behavior is still that.
If my daughter is being a senseless bitch, I hope someone has the balls to stand up to her and tell her. Too many women use their womanhood as an excuse to be terrible to people around them. There is no excuse for being entitled, stuck up, and nasty to those around you, I don't care what gender. In some cases, growing a pair of ovaries and admitting one is wrong MIGHT be the right thing to do.

Personally I think that it's a problem with computing ability. Their on board computer isn't built with as much processing power so of course difficulty getting ahead occurs, couple that with a system designed to keep people in the tax bracket they started in and there is no such thing as "fair." It's shitty all around, man or woman, gender doesn't change that life has hardship. Us men are just told to "man up," but there isn't such a moniker for women, albeit needed. Take responsibility for yourself, only you can change your world, no one is going to hand it to you. Expecting a return on nothing (being born isn't anything YOU do) is literal insanity.

I might also add there was scotch involved in her decision making process
I have no doubt that if my mom DID attend, she would have been polite as shit during, but bad mouthing the hell out of anything that could have been learned at said event. Then again, she thought performing an exorcism on me on my way to CEDU would be helpful lol.

As long as feminists who actually have unbiased agendas allow such idiocy, then feminism IS sexism. More women who have respect and are centered with the ideals of equality (men are men, and women are women and we kinda like each other as we are/should be) need to take up the banner and shout out the REAL feminism ideals so the sexist version dies out.
Right, but because they are the outspoken ones taking up the feminist banner, their ideals will inevitably pervert the perception of what feminism means, therefore they are the reason the movement isn't making progress as it could or should.
Just like the movements of the 60's failed because of the Weather Underground splitting off and bombed US governmental buildings in reply to uncalled for foreign agressive action, feminism WILL fail if the majority of the interactions with "feminists" include blatant displays for sexism to just reverse which gender is downtrodden.
Kitty not if the feminists that you are most likely to encounter or have to listen to are incredibly sexist. Because they loudly proclaim their feminism while uttering disgusting displays of sexism, the two get linked together.
^^ but screwing people wouldn't work for anyone in the long run. Sure you may get ahead for a second (politics aside), but eventually people stop helping you n shit. I believe we have had conversations about a mutual friend who is learning this currently.

As a man, the only proclaimed "feminists" I meet are the offensive, man hating, ball busting, you can agree with me, be saying the exact same thing and i'm STILL going to tell you you're wrong and a pig variety
^hehe
^^ bam, again thank you for joining in and having rational thoughts to give. This post came from the "feminists" (again if they are the loud ones they are the ones that you are more likely to encounter, aka the obstacle to overcome if the movement is to make ANY progress) wanting to take a ball bashing session. The problem is when they are in their emotional "mind" they have nothing of substance to offer as there can be no rational thought going on. They give the ENTIRE movement a bad name and it is the movement's responsibility to weed those idiots out, or shut them up.

Right, the point is that many "feminists" aren't actually interested in the equality bit, if the shoe doesn't fit, throw it away.

^^ Iris, i am 100% pro-choice which means that I accept that you can make a decision about your body that doesn't have to have me involved (although maybe that's where the legislation should come that both parties must be involved and agree). However, at the same time I also know that many women use pregnancy to entrap a male dumb enough to not wrap their pecker into paying them money their entire life. I know several father's who's baby momma has 3-4 different beby daddies, no job and expects the guys she was with for a month to pay for her entire life. I am just suggesting that is taking advantage of a system that will 90% of the time side financial assist to the woman. I'm merely suggesting that the system is flawed (we can all agree) and that there needs to be change.

I have a friend who will remain nameless... She was once babysitting and the little girl wanted to give the hamster a bath. After the bath she wanted to dry the hamster, so the babysitter decided to dry it in the microwave. The little girl was likely scared for life I'm sure.
just wait till she says things like "mommy.... ummm.... i love you."
you look gorgeous, congratulations to the happy couple
FUCK YES
^^ probably correct
^^ google seems to agree that it's like a 50/50 that the rabbit could die.
^^ good choice

yup, it's a pleasure :p

Aye, it has absolutely NOT gotten more potent, Riley is 2000% correct on that. The top strains of today are still merely crosses of shit from the 60's. Thc count had NOT broken 24% and will not. Any claims of 30% are from the ridiculous range in results one often gets from analyzing even the exact same plant. It is a flawed technology that "reads" the content of the plant.

Which is far from the patriotic ideal that founded this country, rebels fighting back against an over taxing, enemy, largely because this same enemy wanted to stop us from printing our own money. In other words, our founding fathers gave the lives if their friends and brothers to not be indebted for all of eternity through centralized banking, a system we have again allowed to take control. Look to Acapulco, they haven't had a police force in over a month. I think you can take that you likely haven't heard that to mean that it isn't going terrible or in a way the mass media outlet could twist to make it look terrible. The bottom line is continuing to go along with and spend every waking moment fighting the symptom of the disease will never fix the problem. Again you will likely not have heard much of anything about this, but at our current rate of expansion we will have permanently changed the Earth's atmosphere by +6 degrees by 2033. This will be an end to all polar ice caps, glaciers and likely arctic species. If we widely accept that we live in a "fragile" ecosystem, how well do you think it will deal with the loss of thousands of not millions of species? Of course the time span I'm quoting is before China adds more cars (they already had a 14 DAY traffic jam), as well as BP and other gas giants pumping billions into Nigeria and a couple other coastal African companies as oil reserves have been found off the coast. I'm sure the people of that local will start purchasing vehicles, just as soon as their economy sees the upsurge of foreign investment start getting distributed. The problem is you are no more than the number in your bank. If you don't have the donation power Trump, Ronald McDonald, Microsoft, Coca-Cola and other such PEOPLE can offer a political campaign, then you don't count and the system doesn't care. This country is NOT a business, continuing to let executives run it will continue to garner the same results. The only TRUE successful means of opposition is to do as Ghandi and MLK did and keep showing up peacefully to get your ass kicked. The Hong Kong protestors WILL win, if they continue with the respectful and polite defiance, joining the system hasn't worked with almost 60 years since the Hippie generation left school and became one with the man. You may notice, old Hippies are often today's Yuppies. Looks to me like the evidence points to the system winning, even against the moral defenders who bravely supported their troops by getting brutalized by the very same force that put the soldiers in harms way.
Kate, unless you make out with with a carrier, have very close contact with their bodily fluid or kiss a recently deceased corpse, you'll not come in contact with it. I'd imagine the statistical liklihood of marrying Rush quite a lot higher than that of Ebola. Considering his longest of the 4 marriages he's been in is 10 years, he likely has at least 4 more wives to go through. How many corpses do you kiss?
Exactly what happened to the pet prior to you ;)
Kevin this gives me ideas for the little durpster, Ollie.

Why continue to give credence to the failed and corrupted system rather than put our energy towards something more productive like how to stop the shitslide from continuing ad infinitum.
To be honest, I worry about what we'll see in our life time. We literally cannot keep going as we are, or we reap our own destruction.
Just proof that America is fucked and has been for a LONG time. Any system that not only allows idiots like this to succeed in life, but to rise to a position of power over the people is clearly sick and damaged and in SERIOUS need of reform.
Highly unlikely that it's the Kardashians, although they DO put themselves off as a moronic spectacle of T&A minus any braincells. It would be mighty ninja to hide so ridiculously open like that. Gold DOES tend to appreciate in value, but is really heavy and a pain in the ass to haul around. We just look at the system as if it'll go on forever, "tis the way it's always been, let's just continue using it." However the reality is there is literally nowhere good the system can lead, we are running out of resources at a very rapid rate because the system mandates waste by products of an economy doesn't flow. In other words, you can literally expect the max lifespan of your product is the warranty lifetime. An example would be the Xbox 360 I owned that literally blew out two days outside of warranty, of course the company wouldn't replace it and suggested that I simply buy another one. If they had built the product to last they wouldn't have gotten the opportunity to attempt a second sale.
Rhonda, the proof lies in the way we print our money, IMO. We run on a centralized banking system, which means that our government takes the paper money (although i believe it's something like 75% of the "money" we have is nothing more than a number online) at a loan from the Federal Reserve Bank, which is NOT a Federally owned institution. In fact, the Fed is mostly run by foreign banking interests. The sad reality is we have no way of knowing which corporation, family, orginization, etc is the puppet master.
I love you for this :p
I've been saying it for years.
valid point.
also, 140 characters is not anywhere near enough to list facts, merely cut down hyperlinks with a couple words. Twitter has way diff rules than FB, he did pretty well considering the requirements
Sarah, she HAS to know all of the facts already and just spouts the filth because that's what her agenda setting bosses pay her ass to do. I'm willing to bet she's FAR from stupid, just loudspoken and willing to act like she's a total tardo.
not surprised in the least
Guess Govey taught her her lesson about bad taste in men.
I went to prison for a DUI 0.00, believe me I know exactly how "just" the legal system is. It's quite simple, we do NOT live in a free country, we live in a country that is free until you meet an officer of the law who will ensure that you may have come for vacation, but you'll sure stay on probation.
Alvin, did you know Acapulco hasn't had ANY police force in over a month?
^^ everything she spouts is food for the idiots of the country who believe everything the idiot box tells them.
"You're a fucking dumbass." lol so elegant
Meant for family, have had issues with reports back to my parents who don't need to make judgements on my life based on the telephone game.

I don't see the point to comparing dying of natural causes to dying at the hand of an invasive, hostile enemy.
Agenda setting at it's best, tactics we learned from the infamous Hitler who's cleaver use of propaganda videos made readily available to the public gave the man his rise to power. Then again Hitler learned the word genocide from what our founding fathers did to the native populations and still falls 40 million short of our total body count.

Lol
YES WE DO!!
lmfao, priceless
The US government has known this since at least 2003 when they bought the patent for ALL cannabinoid related medicines. What follows is a quote from the patent...
“Cannabinoids have been found to have antioxidant properties, unrelated to NMDA receptor antagonism. This new found property makes cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and HIV dementia.”
^^ this lol
Goes perfectly with your beard, good job ;)
it DID look like a mess of brains though
i'm just gonna say, the flavor combo is wretched sounding.
looks like hitler's celebrating halloween in hell this year.
We are blindly walking into it, willingly. I'm betting the next play will be to full out ban guns. Then they are going to use those lovely new police tanks to forcibly take them or kill us, your choice of course.
Jason, the big problem is where it must lead, hense the push for disarmament. I'm starting to think China wins and things will get a lot worse. The media operates via textbook Hitler tactics, propaganda videos and agenda setting campaigns readily available to the masses. On the rare case they do hit upon the truth, they quickly change the topic and slam it at you in high levels.
Not if he remembers high school right. Sounds like teen lust gone right. Lol
I watch it first thing Monday and will not be playing facebook or Twitter tonight. The trade off is I can watch the episode, pause, rewind and then immediately watch it again, should I so choose.
What happened now?
Boston was just practice hostilely taking over a city, and now police departments everywhere have those new armored vehicles for their swat.. Saw Atlanta's sand colored armored transports, now sporting flashing blues on top, on manuevers the other night. good times

Ducks and especially ducklings have an existence mostly of eating and pooping. I'm also reasonably sure they manage to do more of the latter than the former.

It's like a regular handshake only down undah ;)
I haven't done the austrailian handshake on you Dani, you could yet have a dangle lol
Money is the root, it is what keeps us from the basic freedom of movement every other species on the planet enjoys. Before the money systems took off and the central bank scam was sold to the people, even humans were able to cross property as needed. With the central banking system came the obsessive need to turn everything into a value to pay back the balance of the very fair loan to have the money in the first place. Also with this system is a necessary need for them to break faster. A vacuum from the 60's will still work today, whereas a vacuum bought in the 2000's is probably been burnt out and replaced by now. The Model T was another example, one could fix it using just a wrench, and the parts are easy to change out, plus it will again run quite strong today and is able to be fixed by the owner. Today's cars are overblown piles of garbage that are designed to break, wear down and require someone who went to school to fix, your very freedom to easily fix your goods without the need to expensive help has vanished. Sad right?

I'm a pinot noir guy, but it couldn't be more wrong about the resoning. I choose it because it pairs with most of the gourmet meals (suuuuper easy but look difficult to acomplish recipes) I use when wooing women. Plus most women who "don't like red wine," find that pinot has a fruitier body and less dryness that many reds. A zombie that cooks real well surely isn't trying to eat you, you're safe(ish). bwahahahahahaha

OMG, yes. I survived my childhood by escaping into a world of books. Funny story, I read so much in high school that my boarding school banned me from reading outside of class. Then again, in 2 years I read the entire school library's fiction section (minus westerns and a couple other genre's i'm not overly fond of). Pretty sure there was a 4-6 month period where I didn't talk to anyone outside of class. Time has little to no meaning to me when i'm absorbed, however I also was knocking back a little "light" reading between lunch and dinner often a full 1000 page book.

Lets face it, cannabis turning out to NOT cause people to go into a murder/rape binge, in that order, means that the powers that be tricked the American population into prohibiting the best medicine known to man, likely because it would harm their interests in the textile, paper, building material, food, medicne industries. In any other world but politics that would be a crime, one that considering the incredibly large amount of money they have tricked us into spending to keep industries responsible for destroying the planet in power, well I believe that would be a grand larceny on an unprecidented scale (amount excedes $10,000). At $450k taxpayers pay for every person locked up as a prisoner of war, every year of their incarceration (multiply above number by the 6,977,700 people behind bars in 2011). I don't know how many of you have been to the clink, but from experience there is NO FUCKING WAY they spend that much money per person locked up, I'd say they spent far less than those in section 8 housing for lodging and food, the guards would be where the money is and they are paid far less than the job deserves. The bottom line is, Nixon and Hitler are far more similar than you would think and that was just the start of our government using the SAME propagaganda tactics to create their legacy. It is the same tactic that our government uses to say enter war (Follywood sadly is in on the sceme). Before the actual "lets go to war" decision you'll notice Follywood releases movies glorifying old wars, ones where the soldiers were actually hero's. Coercing the american population into a desensitization of the entire idea. Honestly, I question all the "facts" that are fed down from the top, there is no other way to interperit their aggression on the citizens they are sworn to protect and look out for, they are literally at war with the citizens to fatten their wallets. I learned not to trust our government from the Native Americans, "here, take these blankets so you will be warm on this shitty land we are wiping your race out on.... I mean, giving you out of the kindness of our hearts." (100,000,000 Native Americans slaughtered by our founding fathers, 60,000,000 jewish slaughtered by Nazi's, still think we're the good guys?)

^^ to go along with that, my ex-gf was a long time comic fan, prior to us meeting. Lets just say she spent the better part of a year trying to use her womanly whiles to coerce me into spilling the beans. Seriously my favorite tactic that ladies try to employee. Word to the ladies, a smart man will STILL not tell you, cause you'll only try harder and longer to get what you want. The minute we break, all the extra devil vagina magic ends. The obvious best choice would be to refuse and keep the extra lovins like a greedy bastard :p
Group: The Walking Dead Fan Base
I mean, the best part of the show is the element of shock. They have a brilliant team of writersthat are quite practiced at not giving away their spoilers. It's SUUUUUPER hard waiting for the actual episode to air. Imagine if you will, you have 6 months to a year, thousands of fans wanting to know what you know and more than a few thinking they are sly about how they are going to get spoilers. When have you EVER held a secret 100% to yourself that long? Especially one that all your friends, family, etc WAAAANT to know about and will excitedly talk for hours about the subject, as you are trying to keep it real freaking invisible. Sure we may be uncomfortable (Hershel's leg had me blind from the contacts, slumped on a floor covered in paper mache (dry and powdered) with dust flying up everywhere for SIX hours. Yup, it REALLY took that long to capture the images in a way that would allow their editing wizards to cut the scene together in what looked like continuous motion. That was the tedius part, after we had the building blocks necessary to make the fall look like it happened all in a matter of seconds, rather than hours, the bite was done on what they called the rehersal take.

Not so sure that add benefit quite adds up to me magically being in the group chasing after the redneck who shot me.
Erik, the fault for getting bit is ALWAYS on the side of the giant creature that is scary and dumb enough to back a scared animal into a place where certain death from fighting back is the only choice left. If a giant were trying to mess with me, I would likely bite the fuck out of it too, just sayin. Remember this was their house before we built our false environment and destroyed large swaths of natural habitats in our obsessive need to turn beauty into some asshole's cash cow (at the expense of the well being if everyone else on the planet). It's been what 250 years since the industrial revolution, which seems an incredibly short time to have brought the planet to the brink of disaster. It is expected that at the current rate of expansion (not including the billions BP, She'll, etc are sending to drill in the ocean off the coast of Nigeria or China making Atlanta traffic look pleasant with their 14 day, no snow traffic jam) that we will have destroyed the planet by changing the earth's standard temperature to +6 degrees. +6 is to our current understanding irreversible and will also herald the last glaciers, icebergs, and polar ice caps. If we have a fragile ecosystem that requires delicate balance or it falls out of harmony, what do you think will happen with the loss of ALL arctic species? The bottom line is, we very easily could witness the end of humanity.

Well thank you my dear. It is always nice to get reassurance one is doing their job right. Failure to be entertaining and choosing the entertainment industry as my career path would be about as smart as playing russian rullette with 5 bullets in the chamber, in my opinion.

I do however need to figure out how to better translate tones of sarcasm and dry writ into written word. I often find that a lot of my story's loose depth once they are two dimmensional and totally lacking tonal inflection and body language (both HUUUUGE parts of linguistics 10000% lost with writing. I have this problem chatting on face book a lot and will eventually work it all out.

Funny story, that's like the thrid time this weekend that has been suggested, lol. I get told that at least once a week. Add that up over the past 8 years and I'm probably silly for not already being talking to a publisher, lol.
spider's a spider, more a friend than an enemy. nurture that relationship and he'll clean your outdoor area of those pesky insects we create aweful sprays to drive out.
You're talking to a guy who used to be a traumatized child who watched arachnaphobia in theaters. My fear was overcome while on a camping trip. Some chick in the group went to step on a spider next to me and without any thought i cupped my hand over the spider to protect it, by the time I realized my error, the spider was on my hand. He got carried far off and deposited safely to a tree. I lived and was thusly no longer traumatized by the 37 differnt spiders they used in filming the movie.
Yall were a blast, I set aside some time tomorrow to check out yalls podcasts etc. Only had a few minutes to poke around the site earlier, diggin what I see so far. :-D
Group: The Walking Dead Fan Base
Skot, I have the t-shirt and a tattoo involving a skull and a lightning bolt, Plus i took my freshman year of college at the crunchiest of hippie schools. I'm talking a place where graduates go on to teach NOLS, Outward Bound, or staff wilderness experiences for delenquate teens. I may be a few years ahead of that becoming my food. Hell why do you think I was in prison in the first place. Damned cops got me for a roach man, can you believe that??
so why fear something that has never hurt you (to your knowledge) especially when it strictly feeds on other insects (such as the mosquito's that are so fierce down here). I'm actually going to try to buy an egg sac for any future property i might get, natures factory build bug repellant.
Group: The Walking Dead Fan Base
O'tressa, it has been a blast. I was a fan long before i ever stepped onto the farm set. I was stoked from the first episode. While they were still filming S1, they shot a scene near the Sbux I was working at. Naturally that meant we had an influx of traffic and us actors love our coffee (especially us zombies) so we had a lot of the zombies from that day come in all excited. Somewhere during my shit, in walks the lovely Melissa McBride wearing a dog tag that read zombie #1, naturally I put this quiet observation to the tune of the day (zombie actors hording at our door talking about this show). When she got to the register to place her order I went straight with "you must be with that zombie production I hear is shotting not far...." You'd be amazed how a quick read of a nametag and using the person's name really freaks them out and lets face it, if people were well rested, they probably wouldn't be in Starbucks in the first place. After her moments of shock ended at the psychic barrista who she had just encountered she told me a basic rundown of the show and was such a delightful lady that I couldn't NOT turn on the toob when the pilot premiered. To end this short story, when I saw her on set next and we crossed paths, she remembered me as starbucks guy. Another little odd bit of history, I likely met her when I got hired for my first acting gig, she used to work at that very same casting company and is where she got her start. Small world right?
I bet you like the insects that is the spiders diet less. Aside from looking creepy, I'm willing to bet you haven't been eaten up by one, likely never even bitten.

I want more about morrisey's heads in the tank. Comic Govey I believe was delight at the terror he had been able to wreak, arguably govey did the hellecopter a kindness in ending him quickly rather than letting the onset of bacteria give him a slow and EXTREEMLY painful death (not enough medical supplies to justify attempting to save a life you cannot) His heads could in fact be a reminder to himself about every time he had to cross his morals, a way to hold on to his "humanity" if you will.
Group: The Walking Dead Fan Base
IF absinance became the standard teaaching I'd suggest giving the goveys time in the storage unit (comic stuffers) to the little girls and telling them that all men were like that. It would probably be FAR more effective than any current program. Morrisey's Govey was undeniably sleak, sexy and charismatic.
Group: The Walking Dead Fan Base
^^ Govey character is my absolute favorite, the contrast between him and the comic govey is beyond amazing. The psychology of each is fascinating to me.
Group: The Walking Dead Fan Base
I'm sure by now yall have gotten to know a few of us zombies, for those that don't know us, seriously it's ironic that some of the nicest people I know always play rotten roles or villans. Through my role on TWD I got networked with Dave Vescio (check out his reel on youtube, dude plays a great creep) the combination of the two made me realize, I really do enjoy the chance to behave terribly and play the part of of the guy creep or villan. I think I may yet choose a life of evil science (cue mad scientist laughter) :p

I say that means that Merle's loyalty to Daryl goes so far as keeping him alive, not necessarily ensuring he is happy and enjoys his life.
Group: The Walking Dead Fan Base
With his brother the loyalty is questionable, he has already dragged Daryl through a shady life that suited Merle. Look at Daryl now, he's strong and fierce, yes, but is truly becoming the opposite of his brother, yet gets the same results. He is in it for everyone's well being, not just his own

Merle is a character of deep honor, much like a samurai. However unlike the samurai, he only is looking out for Merle what he needs, no matter the cost. He would be a valuable asset to ANY survivalist group as he's the guy (much like Shane) that will do whatever it takes to get his need met and him in one piece.

I am currently working on writing/producing a script with an old friend of mine from boarding school. Script is in revision phase, still lacking propper formatting, and flushing out some more scenes. I have also been working with several smaller indie films and class projects fellow students dream up.

They stopped using BBQ I think all the way back on the highway, long before I came on in time to get chase the farmer off his land while the sherrif and his delinquent son burn the barn down :p
Group: The Walking Dead Fan Base
honestly, I forget I have it on, it's only uncomfortable for the first hour. Uncomfortable wouldn't be the right word, basically it ends up feeling like your skin has expanded by whatever the depth. Before you get used to it there's like 30 min of itching. The worst part is the airbrush coloring of the eyes, the makeup is mixed with isopropyl alcohol so it dries faster, the fumes are unplesant for a minute or so.

There MAY have been a LOT of alcohol involved in that shoot. The video that didn't save was the one of the fountain we lit under the umbrella prior to the 200 strong missle batter.

they took a leg cast of Scott's leg, created teh hole, added pantyhose, added my teeth and an air pump of blood for the gush. They told me it was rehersal and they weren't blasting the blood. Half way up my pull I realize that I taste sugar and that they musta have fired, Greg called cut and moved on. I was all, wait, what happened to rehearsal dude?
Hershel tasted of pantyhose and molassas lol.
Weird image right?
The zombie that got his teeth yanked is a very good friend of mine Kevin Galbreith. We end up on set a lot together, always in "hero" makeup and usually both talking 8000 miles a minute about philosophy, psychology, metaphysics, etc. Close your eyes and picture two rotten corpses blithely talking about deep subjects that often involve complicated science.

They are all wonderful to work with, tough one to answer.

think i'm missing one but still beat from 13 hours at the Grantville zombie run, yesterday.
Sorry for the delay on reply, shakey connection just loaded this one for me. Thank you much my dear, S2 finale, S3 premier, In the pit when Merle yanked teeth, in the diner for Clear, In the herd with the Michone double.
Can't wait to be there :-D
Sup dude, been ages. How the heck ya been and when we gonna get crazy at a con again?
You know my crazy ass will be having a blast for ya Theo.
Love you too babe :-D
Also actually was out working on a friends indie flick called Fuzz TV earlier. Still a little damp from washing all the bloods off :p.
^^ couldn't be ;)
As the story progresses we're going to be using the striking visuals of the landscape of the intended shooting locaton (locations from Crestone, CO to Taos, NM) to add surreal beauty to the twisted and dark story.
Seriously, I was the center of like a 12 model warmth huddle. It was terrible ;)
I went to a viewing of the S3 premier at a local bar with some other friends from the cast and crew and watched around 100 people freak out when Hershel got ripped up.
A long time friend of mine and a brilliant artist/musician/videographer/writer/rennasance man Orion Mchugh and I are collaborating in putting the story together. He's the lead writer and bounces ideas for terrible death sequences off my sick mind. Basically it's a surreal horror flick set at and titled Willow Lake (see my cover photo of Willow Lake). Kids go camping and wakeup with the lead's character's gf missing from the tent.
As the producer of Willow Lake, I'm pretty good to go, although still a LONG way from shooting.
I love the cold and make a great cuddle buddy for body warmth apparently.
^^ this. If we were and answered, it could result in being in violation of our contracts with AMC.
^^ true story, I just slumped against the wall in the SAME position from the scene with Hershel, inside the building used as the bar from tthe Clear Episode (where Michone and Carl go to the bar/restaurant). Runner after runner made the same blunder Hershey did... and suffered the same fate :p
I was totally miserable being forced to huddle up all close and friendly like with all the lovely model's and actresses cast for the lady zombies. It was a really long and hard night, let me tell you lol
^^ The fairy bite in Pan's Labryth was a condom effect prior to CGI ;)
ninja walker slaughtered all.
Psh, I would cause his ass wouldn't see me coming... Just like Hershel and a lot of the folks at the zombie run last night didn't..
I'd say season 2 finale where it was 25 degrees out and frozen as fuck.
Talk to all the hot models and stuffers :0
Lol, when you hear us creature actors talking about the crap we ate on set for particular shots and you'll understand. I can tell you you have likely seen a movie where condom chewing was what nailed the SFx down prior to CGI additions.
I'd say being in the barn as it was burnt was pretty badass. How often can you say you were inside a building that was intentionally being burnt to the ground, while it was burning :p
^^ this also led to being probably the worst first date story one poor girl will ever have.
My neighbor's kids at my old apt loved me, their parent's hated me. Then again, I was working on making Sfx for the bullet hit effect. Basically the process was playing with fake blood, condoms and firework explosions.
depends on the day
Season two finale, chased the old fart off his land before messing his ass up
Time to come up with 3 billion.
^^ me too, and the govnah
I beleive that is what they used, I was not around on set then.
Sup lovely, you gonna come up to Chatt?
You too my dear, had a blast.
For my scene with Hershel, I was blind for 6 hours and got eyedrops every time the camera stopped. Contacts in the entire time. Basically all I could do was lie back against the wall and close my eyes between takes.
^^ welcome to my world, always gotta tell folks to form an orderly line and I will eat them as soon as their turn comes up.
So basically as long as those things are in, you cannot see.
The contacts, oh god the contacts.
Oh heck yeah, all the cast and big names are fantastic to all of us. T-dog will be horribly missed, he was one that very much o our side ensuring that we had water, food, shade, etc.

^^^ dead on, well played Mrs unarmed opponent in a battle of wits.
Jenna?
now the question is why is that the answer?
^^
here we go... who can get eh answer?

here is a man behind a door.

Another man comes and knocks at the door.

The man behind says “six” the other man says “three”. He comes in.

A second man knocks at the door. The man behind says “seven” and the other man says “five”. He comes in.

I knock at the door , the man behind says “one”.

What number should I say as to come in ?
crap, just had it... hold on a sec gotta find the dang tab
no google :p
^^ fact
cheater's may win, but the win is empty and you really are a looser in the end because of it :p
so, I have a riddle for you :-D
So my favorite books growing up were the Lord of the ring trilogy and the Hobbit, particularly a fun chapter called riddles in the dark...
Launching from my potato gun now Aidan :p

For my giveaway, I have a copy of above photo, signed and shipped to your front door (as soon as my financial aid refund lands, student doesn't pay much)
i dabble with pyrotechnics and alchemy (read with a recipe and supplies can do chemistry and make medicines), quite possibly more important to maintain than a knowlede of edible plants and fungus, plus how to identify them from the deadly stuff (think into the wild, minus the lack of knowledge)
in theaters I might add :p
I saw arachnaphobia at 5... checked the toilet seat for years. lol

Let's face it, any racism that is directed at whites comes from the centuries of bullying everyone else around because we had better weapons. It may have something to do with the reason that we never talk about our heritage, or really have any culture to be proud of. Is there racism against us, yes, is it well founded mistrust, absolutely. My heritage is a proud one of cheating anyone and everyone out of things they didn't understand, all while imposing our way of life on the tribes and cultures we found, while slaughtering them in the name of "god." There is still racism towards the ghettorific type of black individual, but again that fault can be lain at the feet of the rich white folks in power (Obama is 1/2 white which is close enough) for not putting the funding into the education system and giving it out in unequal proportions, starting with the richer white neighborhoods and ending in the poorer far browner areas. Desperate choices between how am i going to survive and which morals shall I sacrifice so I can survive become much easier to make. What people forget about the crime rate is that is the rate of desperate individuals who may have improved their situation with three hots and a cot.

Alvin, one among a plethora of reasons, however that doesn't change the fact that the system is skewed and needs to be fixed. Just because one wears a badge doesn't give them the right to bully ignorant people and walk all over their rights. Sadly, this is happening more and more, instead of less and less. How can anyone even pretend that the system works when only 7% of the entire prison population is in for a violent crime and over 50% are in for what is recognized as a disease (addiction). If people were really being "helped" to better themselves and get away from addiction, why not spend the same $450k per year for every person in jail the government takes from taxpayers every year and send them to the treatment center Lindsey Lohan went to for several months longer than the program actually is and STILL make a nice profit off it. Also, forcing these people to write they have a felony (which bottom line should be reserved for those who are a legitimate danger to society not victimless crimes). By doing something so simple as that we can save likely billions per year which could then be put towards aid programs for the sick and needy and to actually give the education system the full budget it needs with regulations that schools in lower income areas get first priority for budget boosts if you can't get an education you can't can't get a job that pays enough to survive on and desperate times backs someone into a dangerous corner where rationality goes out the window a bit. #bam, I just fixed the education system, programs such as medicare, medicaid and social security (the last of which Uncle Sam owes enough money to count as a corporate crime, lock him up), while also helping addicts see recovery and put an end to their personal nightmare, all by reducing the police force and the amount of pointless arrests that are made. Locking people up is not a business, it's a consequence.
I'm totally going on a long overdue hunt in the pacific northwest. Got my fungi guide loaded for the area (incomplete), plus a couple other guides to cross reference.

^^ was about my experience after they raided my house. They just dumped the drawers onto the floor, tipped stuff over. Honestly, it looked like they got high off the half a gram of hash missing from the police report, drank the missing beer from the fridge and had a hell of a party for 12 hours. The evidence they posed against me was basically the contents of my fridge and pantry (1/2 milk, peanut butter, honey, etc.).

^^ truth, however the base teaching of all religions is the same. The ones that boast the most followers are DEFF about control or death of the heathen. Christians forget so easily that because of their willful ignorance, the world experienced what we call the dark ages and had our technological advancement slowed down to a point where we ended up well behind with out advancement (compared to the pace we had been advancing).

I'd say confirmation that Big Brother is watching you is of pretty big signifigance.
I do not support the government that hunts him in the least bit. This is the same government that violated NATO sanctions that we helped put in place so they could go fight for oil, rather than spending the money used on the illegal war for the betterment of our nation. To to it off, the man responsible, his family and the president's family own a majority of the company that produced our weapons of war and made billions of $. Billions of $$ is gained is more than enough to stand as motive and convict someone of a crime, I vote we charge Bush with treason as there is clear motive linking bush and bin laden families as the benefactors of 9/11.
You realize the Ruby Ridge guy was acquitted of all charges and acted in accordance to the law firing upon an unidentified assailant that had shot and killed his wife and small child in front of his eyes, correct? I say unidentified as anyone can yell they are police over a bullhorn, however the proper way to be identified is with the badge and number every officer is given upon signing up, apparently the court system agrees with me.

yups, gypsy was terrified of Rhian. I don't think it was because the baby itself was frightening, she just didn't want to hurt/scare the baby. As soon as Rhian was sitting up straight they were best buds, especially at dinner.
then again, most of the ones I have come in contact with throughout life have either been total divas, barks so much you wanna rip youre eardrums out and pees the floor any time anyone new comes into the house. The last was a dog i was babysitting while some friends took their honeymoon. My house was a new place, we ultimately bought baby diapers and cut holes for it's tail.

I'm not surprised, the online motor ticket payment system does something very similar and has as long as I've had a drivers license. Let's just say that literally EVERY ticket I've paid (I pointed my license out with a lead foot mind you) my license has still been suspended "due to non-payment."
#love it and #stollen :P
Basically every time I've actually needed police help (ex-wife got hit by her ex bf, was told we can't do anything for you cause she didn't have a bruise. Got robbed and they wouldn't even come to my house to take a report on the stollen goods, "we won't find any of it anyways, no point in making a report."), yet there they were to haul me away to jail for having smoked a joint two days before I was caught driving. The arresting charge DUI after blowing a 0.00 all because I had dreadlocks. In jail I refused to give them blood or urine, as a haircut does not constitute probable cause. Let's just say they took both and convicted me. It was not a pleasant experience and I hadn't been in violation of any driving law at the time of arrest. I learned the hard way that cops aren't your friend and the system is designed to KEEP criminals, not help them see the error of their ways. When you have to sign that you're a felon on every application for the next 7 years, how easy do you think it is to get a job that one can afford to live with, n this day and age?
No worries doll, I don't expect it in the first place. If I was that closed off, I'd have left myself hidden :p

Congrats bro
1 out if 13 black men goto jail while only 1 out of 36 white men do. I think the implications are obvious
The bottom line Alvin is that police today abuse the privilege of serving the community through law enforcement and that I am far more likely to die by police officer than a terroristic attack. This being the case, the police certainly do not NEED armored vehicles with machine gun mounts while at the same time pushing to take away out guns. It is time we stop letting the terribad folks on the force get away with murder (quite literally in many cases). You couldn't have worked on the force that long without seeing your share of shit you want to change. Instead of fighting against change, why not help to create a change that you wanted to see?
Alvin, I have never stated that all police are bad, most of them are guys just trying to do their job. However when doing this particular job becomes a business, as it has, we no longer have room in our prisons for people that legitimately belong there. The police today are a rather bullet happy, shoot first and ask questions later kind of breed. Raised on leather weapon and Beverly Hills cop. Many of them are over zealous in their pursuit of "bad guys. Plus, let's face it, most of the time you see a cop, you're getting pulled over for a concept imagined for separating the idiot from his/her money. Constitutional rights are being horribly abused by some officers who don't even know the laws they are sworn to uphold. I myself have been wrongfully arrested as the victim of an attempted scam by car accident. The officer herself admitted that she knew I hadn't violated any law. Just because the system is in place already, doesn't mean it's the best option. It's high time that citizens stop fearing interactions with the police, the system needs reform.

Population control needed to start 60 years ago, we're grossly over populated, and running through resources that have to last an estimated 6 billion years (expected death of the sun). We may see the end of life as we know it, within the next 20 years, however. By 2033, we will have raised the global temperature by 6 degrees with the damage from our pollution. This is where the earth permanently shifts to what we wrought with our destruction, all polar ice/glacial ice will be melted, all arctic species extinct. Do you think a fragile ecosystem can handle the loss of thousands, if not millions of life forms? What happens to the food supply then?

New talents in Buckhead, it's the van michaels training school. All the cutters/color folk have years in a salon THEN apply for the specialized training. The ones on the floor are just logging their mandatory hours before graduating and charging 200x more. I'd start there
Lol, you'll get the reasoning as soon as you see Ollie's explanatory video. ;)
^^ a large part of the problem is how we setup our monetary system. Since the US government takes a loan from the Federal Reserve for every $ in circulation. Do the math, to pay off the loan another must necessarily be taken out with implied debt for it to be possible to pay back the interest of the last loan. The excuse of we've always done it this way is to accept a system is is destined for ultimate failure rather than change it to a system that benefits more than the owner of the central banks.
I have to cut together some footage a friend took for Ollie. He wanted to teach the worlds dogs how to befriend kittens the easy way lol.

Lol, last time I saw you was when your mom called me and had me drive halfway across the country to cheer you up before you left. :p while I DO have to get out that way, I'm usually locked to when conventions are going down, shooting to be at Wiz world chitown, if possible. Gets me free room and board, plus my flight there if I can book an appearance. Just plan to be a stateside if I book and I'll be there :)
Usually is when I hit that point in the cursing/hexing days. That when the evil mind takes over and the method of their destruction becomes clear. Danger Mr person, danger.
I believe I've been hearing that for 7 years duder, I've seen your parents way more recently :-/

We're in Ga, the law isn't anywhere near that pretty. Your boss doesn't even have to give you a lunch break here. The way it's written is on a monthly scale. In many states there IS a number that if you make less than, TOTAL you are protected, however, this is Ga and they are vested in business interest over person. Not sure if you realize this, but your boss doesn't even have to give you a lunch break here, they are being nice by doing so.

You know what the worst work day in any service industry is?? Sunday, after church lets out more douchebags that don't know how to tip show up, acting entitled and being rude as shit the entire time. From lots of experience.
There is problem with any sort of spirituality that allows people just to say they're sorry on Sunday and be fine. Plus let's face it, all religions preach one core concept, love. As such, instead of creating separation, they should bring people together. Sadly, all it does is make an ocean of separation between peoples.

Bush proved that... Twice. I agree, however if say the third party won (which it well might if everyone who was tossing their vote away tossed it there instead), it might cause very large unplanned fiasco.
All that I've met stoppe and thought before injuring someone. You usually have to really get on their bad side before violence shows up. But what do I know having been homeless on the streets of Boston.

And yes, the Taliban ARE still on CIA payroll and currently get paid as Israeli spies.
I mean lets consider a moment who the Taliban get paid by as members of the Israeli intelligence community, that was created by the CIA... So basically we're just returning spies that were shitty for a soldier who thought joining up would improve his lot in life.

I've worked with them. I figured I owed it since they helped me when I was on the streets of Boston.
The cop responsible should face repercussions, same as the Feds that raided ruby ridge faced a hail of gunfire after shooting dudes wife and infant and had to let him off.
No, but it can help change things faster by spreading awareness that there is an issue in the first place.
Craigslist is a good spot usually. Free and easily accessable. I've had troubles with many other services and no longer use them.
2nd amendment right gives these privileges. The issue where gun incidents occur isn't the person exercising their right to open carry, it's the lunatic that is hiding his. You want the person who open carries around when the nut goes off. That person is likely practiced enough with his piece to turn a terrible incident into less lives lost and innocents hurt. He/she is welcome to open carry anywhere near me.
^^ love these answers lol
Holy congrats dude.

Aye, but you see how it could cause more animosity between groups (remember it's usually the stupid people of any group that case problems).
How would you feel if to honor your murdered friends and family a symbol of Islam, Wiccan, or some other faith system was hung?
^^ you are also a member of the one religion it respects and taught that all the rest are wrong from early enough an age it gets ingrained. It is still disrespectful to those who follow another storybook and don't have the symbol to honor their followers, or consider their loved ones mislabeled. Freedom of religion is about personal choice, not public symbols.
I mean, 9/11 had nothing to do with Jesus and followers of many other religions were lost. There is little reason to add the religious symbols of all the religions to the area, so take the damned cross off.

All of those groups get called out and have some level of assurances in place. However the problem with teachers is the job sucks and is unappreciated with an improper budget to do the job. While yes my tax $ SHOULD be better spent, reducing an unnecessarily large police force that targets mostly small time violations, "illegal" herbs and recreational choices and does little to catch violent offenders (which only make up only about 7% of the prison population) would fit the need. Stopping pounding tons of money into overcrowding our prisons and forcing taxpayers to pay $450k per person behind bars, yearly. School budget solved, fix the police force.
Exactly what they are trying to do in the southeast.

Imagine the world we would live in if everyone was nice and caring to the point of doing random uber nice things for others, without the need to have their ego validated.
a lot might, but a majority either give a terribad addiction, only treat a symptom, or are only a partial fix wihtout any hint at going for the full fix.
Chances are likely that the "medicine" you are currently taking is doing as much, if not more harm than it's preventing. This is ESPECIALLY true if it's a psychological reason to be on the pill, which will only treat a symptom (as most do) rather than actually cure anything.

I don't, but don't have a choice in a couple weeks.
I mean if that's not who you are, why get offended and defensive? Especially saying you yourself have heard of women like that. As a man, it can be easy to find the bad ones, because they are practiced at the deception, just the same that it's easy for a nice woman to find a shitbag bf for the same reason.
What the heck happened?
That thing is uber cool.
You might find women of a different sort if you were a dateable male. Yes there are a lot of shit bag men, but the same is true for women. Take my last roomie for example, short on rent every month, never paid utilities, for her food, etc and still left spouting shit about "responsibility" as she was evicted and forced to move in with her sugar daddy.

Instead of wasting the money to stop them, improve the education system, or impliment a system to help teach them the skills they need to actually GET a job that can support a family.
soooo true
none of those things are covered by food stamps anyways, plus will cost more to implement an efficient system to "fix" the "problem" than it does to keep it the way it is. Outlawing what people choose to do with their free time, or spare money is the same dangerous situation that has led only to over crowded prisons and a police state.

Holy shit dude, what is the world coming to?
I don't want to be minus protection should a gun carrying gangster come into my house and the only person I have been robbed by at gun point was a police officer to the time of $10k for blowing a 0.00 while driving. With 7% of the prison population being a violent offender (read the punishment of removal from society fits the crime). Since the "war" on drugs the prison rate has risen to the point where 25% of the WORLD's Prison population is located here in the states. To give clarity that means we have millions more in prison than even CHINA. I don't wanna pay the $400k+ per year to keep an addict (still a medical issue) in prison without doing a damned thing to say help them better their life. It's immoral.
Lol
It was very tough, the meditation pillows and straight backed posture were grueling for 10 hours a day.

I would imagine that the bar isn't exactly where someone would be drugging a chick to carry her off and rape her. How often do you see a dude literally having to carry a girl? I'd imagine that getting the unconscious body out of the bar without anyone noticing or asking a question would pose issues

Anyone coming into my house better be invited or I assure you there is a plan in place to deal with the incursion. Without showing a warrant I have legal right to presume they are dangerous intruders and cause injury to them. It is for their safety and mine or yours that identification is necessary.

Agree to disagree, or have you not seen the rise of disabled people beat to death, or innocent's shot. I'm not saying that they are bad people, just that they aren't always the best at following the laws they themselves are meant to uphold. Plus lets face it, a job with greater power over others IS liable to draw a certain type of crowd and i can't imagine that all of those drawn are upstanding individuals.
I was cooperative and nice too, however they had no probable cause and I have a 5th amendment right saying that under those circumstances I didn't have to give shit.
I blew no intoxication.
I have been arrested for a DUI after blowing a 0.00, taken to jail where they apparently had the "evidence" to get a warrant to take me to the hospital and forcibly take my urine and blood (I refused on the grounds they had 0 reason to arrest me in the first place). I had smoked a joint at an end of the semester party two days prior so tested positive for THC, apparently you are DUI for 30 days after use cause I got fined $10k, 4 months in prison, 5 years probation, 384 community service hours and a year of the giving my car blowjobs to start it. All for being sober while driving and a joint smoke two days prior. I literally got raped by the law dogs in a way no man should ever experience, I have 0 faith in the "justice" system, nor those who are supposed to uphold the law. When my ex-wife didn't get bruised when her ex bf beat her, they didn't do anything for her. When myself and a friend got robbed, they didn't even come to pretend to investigate. I have friends who the court decided had committed no crime who's car got seized and is now property of the chief of police, he has been told for committing no crime (court ruling) he will not be receiving his car back. I strongly believe that the knowledge should be shared and people should be weary. Just because you haven't had a bad experience yet, doesn't to mean you won't. Aidan, I have a zombie apocalypse house plan, you better believe that includes human assailants. I won't be calling in panic, I'll be calling to have the interlopers carted away,
^^ still not a constitutionally accepted seizure of the house and also one of the reasons our founding fathers started the revolutionary war.
It's official, the constitution is nothing more than toilet paper now. Fourth amendment has been tossed out the window.

I did not, Ashton. I figured as the victim in the accident I was freaking safe, I totally wish I had the video evidence to back it, however what I do have should be more than enough.
Oh most DEFF.

Here's the problem dude, desperate women will do what they did the last time Christians thought it was appropriate to enforce their religious view on everyone else around them, get it done anyways, with much less safe methods. The point being that this is one of those fights that leads to Hell as the lives of EVERY woman lost will solidly be on the hands of everyone who thought that separation of church and state meant every religion but theirs. As we DO still pretend we have a separation, outlawing abortion would be unconstitutional and frankly is taking advice from a VERY primitive peoples who had very little concept of how the world worked. Yes historically even the Catholics "every sperm is sacred" practice made sense, but then again having 6 children did NOT ensure that they would all survive to pass on their DNA too. Now that we have too many people on the planet, it's time to update way outdated religious practices and to stop thinking that our religious view is more important than a follower of another story book whose only notable difference is the characters in the story.

That is where the scam on the people is, talk about a massive profit margin.

All a matter if how you cook it my dear. Healthy food can taste just as good, you just gotta learn to play with spices ;)
Starving is no diet that will work to keep the weight off. Best way to do that is to train yourself to eat about 6 smaller meals a day. This tricks your metabolism into going faster, whereas a diet where you are "starving" will only slow your metabolism down (only slowing your possible progress). As long as you make sure your caloric output (exercise), beats your caloric input per day (what you eat) you will loose weight. :)
Drive faster haha
One would like to think that, but my metabolism is a thing of pure evil... Even using half and half in my sauce, I didn't gain a pound ;). I've hovered at 120-130 lbs (54-58Kg) my entire life and still fit into the clothes I had at 14 ;)

Kevin , factually speaking to start our country, we first committed genocide on 100 million native Americans, rousted them from their homes, forced those that were left to take the most useless land the country had to offer and then re-wrote the history to cover it up. How does that not relate to exactly what Hitler likely would have done had he won WWII? I fail to see how I'm off, considering that I have historic fact, not taught in school, to back all of my earlier comment?
Keep swirling the entire time, lid on. Allow to cool and enjoy ;)
1/4 cup veggie oil, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup popcorn kernels (I recommend the natural food store's dry section). Put oil in pot (make sure you have the lid) and heat at medium. Add sugar and kernels, cover and make sure to keep the sugar mix in motion (swirl) till the popcorn pops.
I haven't made mozzarella specifically, but I have made cheese. It's a lot of fun :)

Imagine the mansion and property y'all could afford with pooled resources from a working gentleman friend and a couple working lady friends. It makes life possible for many people in less fortunate countries with the pooled resources. If what I've seen in Atlanta is any indication, polyamory (multiple partners) is on the rise.
America is fairly isolated in adopting the nuclear family lifestyle. Many other cultures (read a majority of them) embrace a more communal family plan. They cohabitate, split the house work up, and even sexy time duties. We are kinda silly for our insistence on going it alone. I bet as prices skyrocket more people start wishing that they could go that route.

But I'd rather NOT fit in, in a sick society.
^^ I have never denied this fact.
Haha, that universal remote I got worked hahaha.
I'll believe it
^^ See I will calmly explain to the officer that the speed limit sign required so much thought to work out x, that I wasn't focusing enough on the road. If it was clearly labeled without having to do more than read, I would have absolutely followed it. However since i'm not good at algebra, I was unable to follow the speed limit.
^^ it does too much good that ANYONE could EASILY have access to for very little cost. Basically it violates the necessity of an economic based society, an economy comes to a screeching halt if products last and medicines treat the disease rather than a symptom (and likely treating a symptom that is the body's natural defense against the disease, such as a fever).
^^ fully agree, however we live in a nation that bows before the almighty Dollar. It is lord and savior and we ALL strive to get as much as we can.
^^ yeah, my list wont fit on a single page. Let's just say he was an abnormally cute puppy, which is the only reason he survived to become an adult. I might also add, full grown he's 20 lbs and can wreak more destruction than Gypsy has hin her entire life in a matter of minutes.
Keep honking, i'm reloading ;-)
Also, if you have a court order to pay child support, you likely have an order for visitation etc. Check into that, more and more courts are trying to keep the child with the parent that isn't a total fuck up AND is more likely to not impede the parental rights of the other parent (access, etc). Do some google searching, you may find some strong resources to help your case.
Which of course doesn't mean there isn't far more inequality towards women than men, we deff have the better end of the stick (pun intended) everywhere but inside the courtroom.
^^ this
Good lord, I wouldn't. There is very few things in this world I can't stand more than puppies. The on my ex got (ignoring my clear warning that these exact things would happen) ate 5 couches (yes 5, average of $8-900 each), 4 pairs of shoes (average $80-90 each pair), my mom swears her carpet is destroyed cause he peed on it (she is also batshit), 3 other couches (luckily the ones that were mine or shit left by the deadbeat roomie I had for a bit) have had territorial chewing. Moral of he story, many puppies only survive to adulthood because they are too cute to kill, also don't tempt shiva, get your dog from the big boy/girl pens (1 year and up).
Dude mine is doing the same fucking thing because I told her it was bullshit she told me that her hours at work changed so the complicated maybe Wed, maybe Thurs call schedule (that seemed to change quite often making it impossible to keep track of which week was which) to hours that allow me to call every night. Because I wouldn't apologize for saying that was beyond shitty of her, the two weeks of nightly calling I have made have garnered no return. Ga being a state that doesn't recognize unmarried father's as having rights to their children, the woman can do whatever action of retribution she chooses, involving dad's access to his kid. How we can have such a clearly unconstitutional law on he books is beyond me (it was ok for my ex to move out if state without telling me, yet I would go to jail for doing the same thing). I found out last week that since she has been gone long enough to establish residency in another state, my fight has to move to a court a few thousand miles away. If you are on the birth certificate, contact the local ALA (I believe county dependent) and seek assistance petitioning for your rights as a father. If she plays that game after, it will further any change in custody agreement motions you may make in the future. Also, document dates of refusals, time, if anything terrible was said (I'd even go for language, threats, etc, with the child heard in the background)
You still know how to reach me doof and most of my conversations take a decidedly 18+ turn somewhere. ;)
Elisabeth and I started our morning with this the other day, simply fantastic.
Axel Foley for me, pretty on for the reasoning
Me... Ohhhhh shiney
Yay, glad to hear it. Reiki still heading your way :)
It also puts all the power of growing and dispensing he medication to 5 universities in the state, if they so choose. Again, we could end up with a law on the books that is never used. They have effectively privatized the ability to dispense medication, removing the possibility of thousands of new jobs and really just cutting the subsidies they pay the universities, which only helps those that can AFFORD college (statistically mostly middle class and above children end up going to college/getting degrees).
You cannnot forgit the possibiblity of Siri being a taird face ;)
The main problem with this bill is that it fails to take into account the other safe use medicinal purposes the plant contains in the THC. As such Rep Peake has his heart in the right place, but needs to include the safe pain management side of this powerful medicine. The mandatory not smoked is just a carefully lain trap, IMO. As there will be an obvious difference between legal and "illegal" uses of cannabis, drug arrests for it's use WILL continue. The law is absolute shit.
I'm not really a fan of how they put the law together in the southeast corner of the US. It seems they are severely limiting the medicinal potential of the plant.
Just plain wow
Impatient sure happens when growing hair out, if not down right and pissed off when you can't see cause the tips are sticking in you eyes.
Grow em out and post a pic for us to vote on :p
that is still under investgation.
Giggity to the goo
Google if course.
This post tripped me out till I remembered Australia is in the future lol.
Funny how developing happiness comes before reasons to validate said happiness.
Sweet
Totally true Melissa
That photo isn't photoshopped?
Psh, you know it's true
Australia is most definitely one of the places I have to visit on the bucket list. Namely so I can check out all the cool animals yall have that can kill me :D
don't be hatin, you's a hottie.
You do look damned good in heels :P
^^ ya booze :-p
^^ she is totally looking UBER sexy in stripes, the'll look better on the floor though :-O
Bet the Melbourne show was rockin. Have yet to get across the pond, but have been to all but 6, here.
It's gotta be awesome
Right? They were MUCH scarier in my day.
also turns out the Avett Brothers (http://bit.ly/1k2ou54) will be there.
http://bit.ly/1k2ou54
It is my favorite venue I've ever been to and I got to see one of the greats there, Bob Dylan... SECOND row.
Ehhh?? Yall coming half way around the world to rock out for a weekend in one of the cooler states in the US? Would be freakin sweet if a good show happened to be playing at Red Rocks Amphitheater (http://bit.ly/1gglHko) at the same time.
http://bit.ly/1gglHko
#awesome
I miss the road, le sigh.
cheers :-D
And a big congrats to the newlyweds albeit would have already had a common law marriage here.
Sara
Y'all realize it is exactly how they have increased their power so much we now see stories of ridiculous abuse of power in movie style scenarios. We have gotten so used to them on the road, we never noticed the number of police increasing rapidly. Humvee's release to citizens only marked the beginning of what we see now, police armed with military vehicles and better armor than is given to our boys fighting in a war zone. All that is needed to face a citizen?
That is exactly why they aren't alright. "You get used to seeing them." We have been naturalized to be so used to seeing more and more cop looking cars on the road, so much so we failed to notice the fist closing down and cops becoming a literal threat to our civil liberties and rights. Again the same tactic has worked through the use of Humvee's released to civilians. We got used to seeing them on the road, now our police have them and are super trained, better equipped versions of what we have fighting overseas. Welcome home boys, wanna keep killing for us?
No shit
See ya in a few for some boobie shotz
Ya know, it's funny to watch how linguistically we change as popular feeling sways towards a more colorblind crowd (younger generations). Chris Rock's "niggers vs niggas" bit always struck me, as I've learned more about linguistics I can look and see definitions morph before our very eyes. "That's gay" no longer seems to give a damn about homosexuality, but just be a broad derogatory thing to say about anything.
I always saw you as a wood sprite or a nymph. Not surprised in the least.
Love it
Totally placing an order for the boobie ice mold ASAP
I'd rather not fuck autocorrect, a good hate fuck can be fun on occasion, but with the way I despise Siri's bitch ass, it'd end up like a bad night in Vegas...
awww #love right back girlo
DEFF come blast it up again Tara. Hell, make that new fiancé bring you down here to partay :p
^^ I will have many blasts, and a few legal blazes. :)
Giggity lol
^^ this
Me too :)
See ya after the coma
Hanging with my hommie Big Country Zombie huh?
Don't feel bad ladies, the feature released a month or two back.
Badass
^^ seen that happen, Nick. Dumbass bar owner went without a band cause one dude didn't have his ID on him. #fail
Always a weird day
Great idea Aidan, think I'll go slaughter some right now.
^^ deff a great thought if you are in a more rural area. Keep your head low and observe what is going on around you. Best off if you have a stash of cans and MRE's ready to go.
Imagine having Timothy Leary over and going to that bathroom like 3-5 hours later...
You go right on ahead, I'm going to stay away from any and all stores that sell food. Not the zombies you gots to worry about ;)
^^ bringing people together one stupid post at a time :-p
It's a long hard ride to quit the innuendo biz. Only through discipline and reward for surviving the day without pleasuring yourself with the use of innuendo will you overcome the desire.
Woot, glad you had fun. Congrats on getting out there and going for it.
Vacation to Colorado huh?
If only I didn't have class on Thurs, DEFF looks like a good workshop to attend.
Jackets only if it's cold outside.
Lmfao, I know what my cat would do... Pee on my jacket or clean laundry in retaliation.
And likely experience much of what Paul said lol.

You should make that sooner rather than later :)

And when were yall planning on coming by to hang out??
probably, but it WOULD freeze the vodka :)

Hope all is well dude
Don't gotta lie to kick it Becky, we all know you like to clean your tonsils out when you masturbate. Gotta have the full insides rearranged feeling when you done, it's cool.
What's it doing in your room then Becky?
Dude, IDK, it was freaking me out standing 10' tall in the corner. Had to move it somewhere.
Dude, I know all about it ;)

Tis always nice to sit back and count your blessings and a good day when you realize how many blessings you actually have. Glad life is going well, keep up the rockin momentum. Get it girlo.
ummm, giggity. looking good girlie
*smacks Becky with a pillow for the hell of it* :-D
lol, and somehow yall would both manage to smack the shit out of me with a pillow to make you breakfast.
The pyramid's are unique as it actually appears they were built starting at the top point and working down. Weird right?
^^ my kinda night, good job y'all :)
I absolutely do too, long time lol.
That does seen pretty standard, tell me y'all didn't kill the stripper.
Congrats lady
Congrats :)
My last day in he clinic was 12 FIV positive kittens needing to be out down. I did my job, but hated every second of it.
I'm so down for a road trip to take advantage of that ;)
Not his fault y'all are gullible and want to believe in an idea that clearly doesn't exist in reality, just saying.
^^ fail
^^ no money in a cure
Awesome :)
I have killed more than a few, then again I worked at the clinic at the Atlanta Humane Society.
Baby blue.
Not surprised in the least. Fuck the police state.
I got arrested and convicted for a DUI 0.00, all because a haircut (dreadlocks) was enough probable cause to get a warrant to forcibly take blood and urine. Happened in Arizona in 2005, I was fined 10k and had to beg forgiveness for smoking a joint two days before I was behind the wheel of my car in court to receive 4 month prison over 2.5 years, probation for 5 years and 400 hours community service.
Sounds about exactly how it's supposed to be :)
You do know that snake is perfectly harmless and even gets used as a baby sitter in Thailand, right?
Well played
I have come home to that exact sight a few times ;)
Eat like 12 almonds
Stone cold dawg, you got nerves of steal. Next time put black tape over the record light lol
I have a perfect spot, but I can't tell you else it would ruin the perfection. Stay away from wal-mart, it will become a bloody mess there, most likely from survivors shooting survivors first.
congrats
Love it
Thx ladies :)
I will let that pass...
He must poke holes in the outer water bottles, which also contain something to filter the gas a touch.
That is straight photoshop
Nah, just playin. Looks good dude :)
I see it, I see the grey hair, OMG dude
^^ used it a lot at NWA ;)
I bet you will too
Sorry I made you get off the elevator Sara , totally my b.
good question, mine sure didn't
^^ me too lol
nothing is free in this land of ours dude.
Drools
Get one dude, although it's been ruled as illegal to be 100% off grid.
Dude me too, must has ASAP.
^^ amazing info thanks for jumping in
Sweet
Wow dude, congrats
Most babies don't like the green stuffers
Giggity.
I mean, via the Christian story we are all products if incest and therefore should be totally cool with brothers and sisters getting married.
Believe you me, I am quietly collecting all the evidence I can of her being unstable upstairs.
Who can easily afford such things.
Lawyers are expensive and I don't have help from my parents.
Why are you getting whipped lol?
Same as the kid charged in Az for playing with his airsoft gun. You know, the kind that shoot only rubber billets and are not actual firearms. Ironically in a state where I have personally seen an Uzi for sale in a pawn shop.
Hell no we don't lol
^^ super cool to know.
Lol
^^ bet you hear that shit a lot in Colorado haha
Well DUH
It's a kitten, prolly still ain't quite got licking it's butt clean down, just sayin.
Blushing is a good start, won't be long till your whole face is red and your panting for breath from there ;)
Many inventions you use daily were thought up on LSD, google it.
Don't lie baby, you knows we all want you.
I feel like that word is shifting in meaning almost. I don't believe they are actually making a reference to homosexual behavior but rather using it like it had a totally different meaning. Kinda interesting to watch as public opinion on homosexuality sways, linguistically we are even using the derogatory term in a new way, as just something derogatory to say rather than meaning it's attracted to the same sex. Weird right?

He's not displaying his badge as legally mandated, just the white "police" which doesn't count as him truly identifying himself as an actual offi
It's beneficial to them being able to sustain that revenue jason.
No way that will be sustainable, the numbers are skewed and do not take into account hat will happen when New York and other states follow suite.
From my understanding, it's worse in women's prison.
Except parents that send their kids off to boarding school ;)
Momma duty waits for no woman
1g = $20 3.5g = $60

Damn girl, congratulations.
But it's not getting loaded, vegetative growth CAN make hash or edibles, but it would require oil or booze to also be ingested by the cow (not likely to happen).
Good luck dudes
yay
First we likely need to turn this red state blue
i'm fucking dying laughing and not 1/2 through yet lol
Love Tucson, miss the dessert dearly. Fight the fuck outta that bullshit.
Congrats Dave, you are truly tearing it up.
seriously? le sigh, fuck the south
I see where they are going with this legislation, but it's insidious and really designed to screw the people over helping the environment (which is far more important than congress having a fatter wallet). Without paying bills to existing companies (which the gov now sees as people and needs to "protect" even more than the actual people due to campaign contributions) the taxes gained will be vastly reduced, therefore it's scary to them.
Fuck that would be nice
What is more American than protecting the property value in your neighborhood. You know, the same reason those damnable HOA's are around.
Time to riot
*Dives in* yay :)
In other words no payment exchanged hands for use of crazy cheese.
Crazy cheese isn't a brand name, they used that so they didn't have to pay for rights, it wasn't product placement in the least. Our mind filled in the blank to what the real product obviously is (Cheese Whiz), but it was never direct.
lol
good thing i'm planning on installing battle cameras. for 49.99/mo you can watch bieber get thrown through a wall.
and I have full reign to knock him the fuck out if he acts like a prick
only if he pays all the rent + 20,000 a month directly to me.
congrats
^^ would be nice
That is just plain disgusting displays of ignorance and intolerance. That makes me sick to watch, clearly these "christians" have missed the ENTIRE point of the religion they claim to follow. "love they neighbor" simple as that.
After having a wolf hybrid, i fully agree with his recommendation. Howling at the moon releases something primal within us, try it.
so very true
I think you beat the crap outta it
where's mine damnit
Hope all is well with you my dear.
interesting.
Gentlemen start your engines ;)
Love it :-D
I might also add, the last one will be posted online and I get to take at home, over a week, as many times as I like... I think it's safe to say I'll do ok there, too.
:(
it might be advised to set a timer at the start of your 15 ;)
I embrace a 15 minute break once an hour. Amazingly my second half of study time was FAR more productive than the first. By this I mean I finished 3/4 of my study guide between my last break and now.
If you believe Fox and other mass media idiot makers
^^ just the rich old folk in power screwing the younger generation harder each year.
Motorboating accident just begging to happen ;)
and damned amazing to look at too :P
^^ tell us how you really feel.
super badass :p
^^ agree with this one 2000%, make them carry your ass to the car and into the damned jail itself.
I don't usually like them either, but some are too good to pass up.
Welcome to the American Dream, turns out it's pretty shitty. Good job Amerika.
Way to go

Looks pretty damned good. Did ya use a crockpot?
Have fun
^^ you just described my awful mother lol
Sweet and done ;)
Ummm giggity.
Some may call me a "conspiracy theorist" or "crazy" and that's fine. I choose to question everything and put in lots of research on many of the "theories" based on my findings. After "operation north woods" (seriously look it up if you aren't familiar) we can honestly expect such subversion from the US government.
What other job would a power hungry, narcosistic, bully choose?
^ good one
^ love it man, lol.
Holy badass
Dude that is gorgeous :)
Always a good choice
Couldn't have been better planned, medicine and an army of cookies to fight their munchies.
You're go a go white, sall good brother. Just accept it lol
Pleasure, those are the most badass electric basses I've ever seen.
I make some damned good brownies good sir while they MAY be spiked, they will be damned good.
^^ lol mine too, she's actually turned tricks and done porn since the split lol
Oh noes, glad you's getting better n stuff
Ummm why was that in question?
I feel like the act of caring for and growing their own medicine will be amazingly beneficial to the patients, as much as the increased O2 output they will receive if they go indoor.
I mean, tues, We'd, Thurs you could have use of a truck if you get my arse hired :p
Me too lol
9/11 sure as heck happened, but the facts point to it having to have been at least partly inside job.
Motorcycles DEFF stop a LOT faster, but a bike forced to brake uber fast can easily go down into a slide.
This year she got a "talking" kitty that had me going crazy before I got out of the store, it doesn't shut up :p
Kitty , that's exactly how I pick my presents for holidays, haha. One year she got a stuffed animal that had clip on washable markers to draw on the stuffy. You better believe mommy was shocked when they were used to color all over the walls, daddy knew what would happen haha
^^ excellent
I envy Jay-Z :(
What a Douchy McDoucherson to pop him for being a kid.
Should do the towel method... Just wrap a towel around yourself and answer the door. Upon hearing they want to convert you, politely invite them in while taking a wide stance (which will cause the towel to fall off). They usually find an excuse to quickly gtfo
Pleasure Judith , enjoy :)
I don't know if I'm even responsible for the shenanigans that ensue around me 1/2 the time.
Ohhh could be fun as hell :)
Oh I agree fully, however from a legal standpoint, it is now "justified" training, they fail their job every time it happens. I'm also not saying that I believe that the raised frequency doesn't have anything to do with the push, just that it will be hard to fight that since the law sometimes is interpreted in shitty ways.
Messed up but can easily be defended by saying they have to give practice to be able to protect should a shooting happen again. This is going to be a hard one to avoid because of it.
Let us know what you think, I'm not expecting much :-/
They count what they can measure as a metabolite, FYI as long as it stays in your system (perscription drugs too I presume), you are DUI. I spent some time in the clink for a joint I had smoked two days prior. Facts point to you being DUI and a conviction WILL ensue.
Congrats
Too sweet of you my dear
Pleasure :)
^^ and how many hours do you think we spent slaughtering shit lol.
Happy happy joy joy
^^ thanks Tammy
From the season 3 premier :)
Sure you weren't in a porno?? Those girls get it too :p
Bullshit. You's alive and well in the best place on earth
#agree
Wait, that's not a good thing. Lol
I'm a pro lol.
Let's do that again :)
^^ probably very true.
Good ones ^^
Well you won't get a spoiler from me
Click on the image to see ;)
^^ has clearly never been in the back of a police car. It usually smells like the bladder or bowels of the last drunk brought it.
We fucked up now
^^ thanks my dear, same to you.
Yeah man, would love to see you this weekend.
Same to you brother, bummed we don't have a hangout day today.
Sending reiki your way my dear.
Right but ga has harsher penalties than many other states.
Idk, I was looking at wintering in Canada lol
interwebs :-D
one massive inch
yup
And that's why everywhere else in the world they have chains to put on the tires of the rescue vehicles. We are so boned cause we don't follow the boy scout code of "be prepared."
at my house it's an ice ball fight lol
So many of us just have fond childhood memories of watching her films and are saddened. That does not make the sadness any less real or honest duder.
lmfao
You gonna be on Cell?
Mines a couple years back.
Hey we may get a second week off for booze and those giggity moments. The North will never understand the awesomeness.
Glad I could bring a smile to your face
^^ so hard to wait though. Specially when ALL my devices are yelling at me to download the episode and not a bit of wifi.
Best I luck doll
Ummm, giggity
You ain't alone in that.
Yup, you totally busted me here lol
Probably for the best
lol, nice
I will be watching the episode tomorrow evening, after I download it from iTunes. But VERY much excited, was going crazy during the break.
I think we all know me well enough to say that the 10 day vow of silence will likely be really difficult for me. I'm betting that's the hardest part, aside from being 100% away from any electronics or communication devices.
^^ I expect the same for me, the 10 days of silence will be good for me (also something I have never done)

aka, some of the quieter Buckhead bars where they bust out daddy's CC and will make stupid bets (seriously if you bet in a bar, do not unless you are the one offering the game and KNOW your probability is 90%+ of winning)
Group: Atlanta Lair
I remember several of the lair guys having some connections with promoters. If the loud obnoxious atmosphere clubs offered appealed to me more I would totally use my zombie shit to grease the doors, but I wanna nice cozy place I can make the girl who i'm taking home's bf buy my drinks all night via con games his lady cannot resit playing.
How do you know what I have seen, we ninja are far more secretive than any monster.
#chomp Yawn.... did yall hear that?? sounded like someone's leg going missing
^^ durp, you got dreadies
Group: Atlanta Lair
Literally one into the club idea, rest of us are more the pub/bar types. The kind of places where it's actually easy to have social interactions cause the music isn't uber loud.

I'm not looking to pay to get a headache for dub-crap.
With me around, they always are lol.
Hyway, soon as they arrive I will actually be able to do so again :-D
Just make sure Stephanie is aware you cannot be held responsible for the shenanigans that ensue.
Those of us that tend to get cast opposing the good guy gotta have someone too look up to.
Always man, you learned some really powerful ways to just turn your characters creepy and despicable. Always fun to see what you have in store.
Ninja had to hide by nature as it was death (likely that of their entire village) to defy the lords of the time. Tradition must be followed in respect to those that came before and gave their life for the art. We fear nothing and always strike from your blind spot (or just make you blind). Your confidence is adorable, but you won't even see your death when it arrives.
ORRRR plan for the SECOND book after we make the first a best seller :-D
^^ yup, it's official... i love you and the idears you come up with. SOOOO down, now we just gotta find a way to make that happen on a budget
SO glad Rhian never did that.
OMG Rhian did the same shit, cept clearly she was doing the hungry zombie ;)
Race ya to working with her ;-)
Holy fuck yes, this article is so full of win. New life goal... MUST work with her on some film project or another.
OMG yes, she's amazing (haven't even read the article yet but expect greatnss)
Tis a good way to look at it.
^^ the same reason the ninja were fucking the samurai up (and also why the US lost Vietnam).
One Monster must first distinguish the ninja from everything and everyone else around it.
I know a dojo full of ninja
No doubt.
^^ I have long planned to have this on my epitaph or this one...
"Remember friend as you pass by, as you are now, so once was I, as I am now, so you will be, so prepare yourself to follow me."
Nah, just been away from social media for a bit. Gotta embrace the need for meditative alone time from time to time. Or maybe I was a little tied up, we'll never know
Sara
At least you are likely having fun at work.
Crappy dude.
How was it dude?
Glad everyone is ok, tis some scary shiza
Ummm us please
^^ that's the big problem
#amazing, thanks for sharing.
Damned shame, so sorry he had a terrible relapse like that.
Living in a tree to keep loggers from cutting it down is a pretty good reason. Poo bucket becomes defense from climbing people bent on removing you from the tree. But we're on the wrong coast for all that.
^^ I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable reason for this collection, but I'm not gonna ask lol.
Meh, I just pity them. Imagine how shitty her life is to have to go out of her way to make your day worse. :-/
Shoulda fought snowpocalypse
^^ more chicks should do that.

^^ is that a reflection of mommy's taste?
We still got a week off to go play in a little bit of snow. ;)
Hell yeah, would love to be able to pull a fresh red potato off the vine right before I make up some fries n stuff.
Hahaha, baby dancing is the best
I could even probably do this at my apartment :p
That is a bomb idea.
Ughhh, i freakin HATE HOA's.
Rent a backhoe.
total bs
I got a week off to party and play in the snow. I'm not complaining in the least :P
^^ psshh we shut down the city and get drunk beside the fire. Laugh all you want :-D
Dear Cape Breton, we just had a week long party here in Atlanta over 3 measly inches of snow. :P
Awesome
^^ agreed, but today a little unreasonable
Damn man, totaly missed the living section and took out what looks to be the warehouse area (brewing aging bottling, storing). God really hated them, he fucked their shit up AND took their booze, bad day.
Not the wine field..... damnit.... (also holy shit)
Remember, what you see in television shows are PAID ACTORS one and all. In real life no one would be dumb enough to put a rock on any of their fingers.
Wonder if our wonderful city leaders will be preparing better and say not closing the city all at once
Fuck I wish I had thought of that.
You won't see that without a court order to see they did their job correctly. Hell, the probability is any papers have been shredded over the past few days the city has been shut down. 3 days is a pretty good head start to cover shit up or figure out which underling is going to catch the blame.
Personal responsibility is to do whatever it takes to take care of yourself and those that rely on you. All well and good your mom has an awesome job and you can blow off class, but much if not a majority of the city has to be at work every day to pay their rent at the end of the month. Skipping is an easy thing to say, when you live at home, when you have to pay bills, not always an option.
And many people don't have bosses that would be down for that, loose your job or risk it. So the "personal responsibility" isn't a strong argument.
I don't know how you can consider much of the green "acceptable" place to live.
Plus, if the money that is budgeted to weather related issues clearly wasn't spent on them, where the hell DID they put it?
What needed to be done was not done, the people who are responsible for doing so made everything worse by the way they handled it, while not taking the precautions they were supposed to, it all would have been MUCH different if we had competent leadership that was doing their job
The point is that in 30 years Atlanta has had MUCH worse snow storms than this and been shut down due to weather, not a 14 hour traffic jam.
Dude, we arent' getting through this next round of presidential campaigning without full legalization talk and LOTS of it.
Esmee the point is that the preperations STILL should have been made, it's their fucking job. Saying that the weather changed so many times this season that it's ok that failed their jobs in a huge way is foolish.
Either way, after the last ice storm (the 1/4" thick shit that WAS a big deal), failing to have spent the money in prep for the next time was idiotic.
They didn't close shit in 93, closing down like that WAS the problem. Let's send millions of people onto the roads, all at once, as the snow is starting, without ever taking the precautions we are supposed to to make the roads driveable for them. Most, injuries, damages, etc could have been prevented with the proper pre-treatment on the road ways, an order of sand would have them fully operational at this moment. The reason we have been shut down for a week, again is 100% due to refusal to spend the money on the safety of the citizens you are supposed to be looking out for.
My point exactly, the city was just fine in 93', AND every other time we've had over 3" of snow in the 30 years I have been alive. This one time, however, the whole city falls apart, people get stuck in traffic for 11+ hours, all because the government didn't take the safety precautions they were supposed to.
Lmfao, love it.
Orion
The blizzard of 93 was a MUCH worse snow storm, nothing like this happened then. These guys wanted to keep the money rather than do their job, now they are trying to pass the buck and not take the responsibility. I appreciate what you got there Esmee, but this time it's 100% a case of city negligence. Both of those politicians should be brought up on criminal charges or just stripped of office so we can put someone in who will actually do what they are paid to do.
^^ possibly just an example and not what is on the actual car
Anyone who received one of those should sue the city if they follow through with it, IMO. Had any of the city planning committee actually taken the threat of exactly what happened seriously when local news and radio started reporting it, what 10 days prior, we would have had pre-treated roads, sand, and maybe even a plow or two and it wouldn't have been a big deal. The reason everything was so fucked is the lack of said planning to save $ that will likely be given out as a "bonus"/

10 days prior warning and it all over the news starting Monday... Real unexpected.
Also... In a few hours (when the booze i bought to have an enjoyable snow-in fades back out a bit), if your pops needs rescuing... I'm a crazy mofo that drove the entire time during the last snowmagedadon and I'll come to pick his ass up...
^^ now that I can believe (15 hours after I was forced off my campus at school).
^^ bingo
^^ that being said, offend all the "friends" you want. If they would vote personal comfort over saving lives, they ain't worth my time anyways. (edit... WITH THIS POST)
^^ Dude, I have gotten it for many years, I just recently find my progressive thoughts reflected in law. I also hear a lot of my 100% healthy country mates (who also take extravagant vacations) bitching about their cost going up. Those that don't know anyone who doesn't owe their life to this policy change have jack and shit to say for it, I have requested permission from a friend who really furthered my resolve that this was the way to go to tag them. I do know an individual who was let go from Starbucks due to side effects from the cancer treatment she was only able to afford through the insurance (probably really because cancer will cost the company a butt load in work hours, and money spent on bills). It was a really scary transition for me, I can only imagine what she went through. Watching her experience really kicked in that if you gamble that you will remain healthy, remain employed with insurance, and then DO get sick... You MAY (if not probably will) loose that employment too (and therefore insurance), leaving you (of your family) fucked to save your life. Anyone arguing against it now has 0 forward thinking skills and cannot evaluate to the point where I might not be healthy, employeed, whatever any more.
^^ how do you feel about fish taco?
^^ adventerous, i like it :p

Good news. I have both euphamisms
"Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, it's forgivable to go ass to mouth." Clerks II

Suzanne, perfect example, stupid people then see that bit reported in the media a lot and believe it without thought.

The point is, he still has the nuts and compassion on him to stand up and take the punch to the face to protect those of us that cannot contribute like other people, Trump, Gates, Mcdonald, Wendy, Microsoft, etc.
:P
You really like putting the ball on the Tee for me to knock out of the park, dont you ^^ ;)
^^ bingo... but let's face it... Congress is playing UBER hardball with Obama and has shut down the government twice because they were unwilling to compromise... The likelihood is that LOTS of concessions were made in the passing of this bill.
Modern science may have a love of lab safety (personal to the chemist, not his test subjects), but I have a feeling your more of a Hoffman type.
^^ Spoken with the authority of one with experience... Tell us... How did the rectal test puff feel?
^^ likely 2000% true, but do you think they had the idea to spy on us FOR us before Bush? I'm betting they were mostly looking foreign prior.
^^ It's asthma medicine :P
Which just means that they were like any other child playing with new responsibility... Testing the boundaries. The Patriot Act is what allowed them to even think along the lines of being "Big Brother" (also, maybe a literary favoritism)
fucking awesome
At least you have tired working for you.
My evidence, let's examine the outrage at what Snowden revealed... Which much of America was perfectly ok with when the Patriot Act was passed. The "they won't use it on me" mentality prevails.
The majority never wanted most bills, but were ignorant of it passing and so didn't have their reps do shit about it, simply another day in American politics.
Sam I admire Obama's willingness to stand up to congress and not allow them to rail road the little guy in favor for Trump and his pals. For the first time in my recollection of political figures I feel like we have at least one person who will defy "authority" to favor the majority (not just the rich as politics generally favors).
imagine if you had a per-existing, life threatening, condition and were let go from your job (as many employers try to find reason to do to not have to pay the rising premiums in the employee's insurance). Under that circumstance prior to Obama's health care reform, you were either going to die, or very rich (or are really flipping lucky).
^^^ I KNEW this was going to be one of those posts that took off. I'm glad that everyone managed to take my "selfish prick" declaration with a grain of salt and a shot of he's probably not directing at me (or tequila, your choice).

You also have snow plows, salt/pumice for the roads and tires rated for 4 seasons, we do not.
Brilliant deduction
^^ this photo was from a few hours ago... I had booze when I got home. ;)
That was on my way home, shortly after the snow blanket hit.

Two apps, since IQuit. Start it and set the time for exactly when you put out your last cigarette. Also be sure to put in the price of the cigarettes you smoke and how many a day on average. As you get further away you'll see the money a time clean adding up.
Also, the LiveStrong quitting app.

Suzanne, sometimes things happen like the dog eating the food on the table, that might have been magical. I'm sure the dog had fun and no lasting harm from an oops was had.

Call the local police and send them the transcripts of your interactions planning the fix and his refusal to return your property.
drive over there with a police escort and get your property back while you watch him taken away in cuffs for violation of the law. If he's across a state boarder than becomes a Federal charge and it'll be a REALLY bad day to be him.

Yes, I did just say that Ancient Aliens is more probable than ANY religious text being true.
It would be a FAR safer bet to back ancient societies ascribing godlike attributes to technologically advanced alien cultures than any religious "god" being a factual being. The number of possible outcomes (God, allah, buddah, shiva, aliens, etc) vs the number of possible sources (infinitely large universe, with an infinite number of possible home sources for said alien species) makes it the bet a gambling man/woman would go all in for.

I mean, factually Obama is doing better than any president in my life, yes the hikes were larger, but remember bush spent 5.6 mill in the first attack on Iraq. Where do you think the extra spending came from? Our army illegally fighting a war in a land that never attacked us (Iraq).
Also likely to be saying that Republicans can manage the money better. As one can see, the debt ceiling gets raised FAR more often by republican than democrat president.
Then they are REALLY bad at math and understanding graphs.

You realize we cannot have money without debt, right? The problem isn't ANY president, it's the system that allows the Fed (a private bank and not a governmental agency) to print money and sell it to the government with interest. Aka, the system is working EXACTLY as it must and isn't fucked because of whoever the current face to toss tomatoes is (president ____). Remember politics is more about who financed the campaign than who is running.

I can come to lobby day for one hour before I have to be in classes till 4pm, sorry I didn't reply prior.

I also just wrote a letter to the president with a variety of reasons, one to implore him to see that the federal government brings up the WV company responsible for all the water issues on environmental malpractice charges, other environmental concerns (such as them possibly choosing to classify information that says we have already gone past environmental D-day rather than "induce a panic" should such a report ever come), as well as outlined a solid line of reasoning to rally behind full legalization for cannabis (jobs, new sustainable industry, internal oil/gasoline production, millions of jobs, tourism and a revitalized economy that anyone can become a part of) and a cry for him to once again put on his big boy pants and fight for the people.
You realize Atlanta is the home away from home for the Mexican cartel, right?
lol, no worries, I appreciate the input.
Virus riddled or not, still terrible and it would really depend on what the foam is made of, I'm sure there are some organic foaming agents that would create a foam that was thick enough to suffocate a large group of chickens, the question is is it cheaper than synthetic.
but for their awful crime, yeah, not much.
Right, also 384 hours of community service, 5 years probation (and the fees that come with it) and the blowjob device to start my car (lots of monthly fees).
IDK, I spent 4 months in prision charged for a DUI I blew a 0.00 for. I was fined 10k, shucked out 15k on my lawyer and then couldn't get a job (felon) and no longer had a college fund. Seems like a pretty steep punishment for smoking a joint two days before I was allegedly DUI.
Frankly, I don't even know if she remembers who Nana is or any of it. Simply because Nana cannot be bothered to try.
I bet you'll be simply aweful at pretending to be a corpse, hard to not squirm while being eaten :P
Awsome article, thanks for posting this.
Both terrible form IMO
Funny, Rhian went a full year without a present or word from Nana because Nana didn't get thanked by Mommy for Xmas presents sent. *facepalm*
Sad day when you can trust a junkie as a higher moral authority than a priest.
I often don't even do the one cup anymore :-/
With as well as the rest if the gov plays with Obama, I think it's likely he has little to nothing to do with the NSA's wiretapping (which started prior to him assuming office). If any prez can shoulder the blame it's Bush, who the program likely started under.
All one has to do to make banging a prostitute legal is to get a consent form, video tape it and sell it. Video taping and putting it online protected those sicko's under first amendment rights (should be federally overruled as animal abuse). Unless such happens, this case will actually become a legalistic nightmare. Precedent has been set that the video made a clear abuse case a first amendment free-be, as this sets a trend a particularly larcenous lawyer could use it to similarly defend a client's freedom of expression for many alternate crimes video taped. If Vick went down for making dogs fight, there is no precedent that would make torture ok. Why do I say this, cause the two pictured looks like they have grown up and never left the same small town they were born in, and Vick is a pro athelete. The only difference in cases (abuse wise) is the video tape, which somehow nullified the criminal offense by going public.
^^ this video serious needs to be brought up the next time an anti-gay rights person brings up the P.I.B argument.
Evidence points to a rising trend in taping the crime and selling it to make it legal, who the fuck knows any more Caroline.
:p
or a hormonal woman on the sauce.
Aint nothing merry about a hormonal woman.

Since when do either of YALL want a boring existence where the answer to everything is drugs?

I value animal life over human life, to be honest. We have been given so much advantage over the animal kingdom, yet choose to use it to destroy what gives us all life, all while acting like it's our "right" as the "higher" species. We have proven ourselves terrible stewards of the earth and as such have less value to the greater good (planetary) than our furry brothers.
I say stone them, being hit with rocks REALLY hurts, plus will lead to death with enough rocks thrown.. It's just a slow and agonizing one rather than the painless crap they give the murderers on death row.
adorable
Funny story, you're just as likely to catch him compromised as you always were. He's just less likely to find it funny when I jokingly refer to it as a senior moment (he just turned 76).
Nah, that's just how you know you're settled down and married ;-). You'll know you're old the first time you find yourself flicking off a neighborhood kid, in your underwear, not knowing how you got there ;-)
^^ he did that cause they published two of my poems prior, lol.
They will contact you and try to sell you an anthology book. My father did a tester and wrote some awful gibberish, they published it, lol.
I cannot loose "friends" as I wouldn't be friends with a biggot, anyways. The only person I could loose is someone who would have eventually parted ways anyways. In no way, shape, or form would that be a loss to me.

If you want to see idea's like this available for affordable prices one could always help the designer by sharing the hell out of it. Apparently there is no manufacturer for the product so it's still homemade.
^^ costs $3500-$5000 :-/ dug the shit outta it till the price tag.
^^ I won't loose friends over this, but I am fully supportive.
Also right back atcha :p
^^ thanks hommie. :)
Shit the model T Ford was designed to run on hemp oil in the first place.
^^ another perfect fit :)
I am so there Ula, have decide if I wanna go west first though :pi
Lmfao, silence in my house equals Ollie is asleep or being naughty. It's taken me over a year to catch him head in trash (stopped him for a week then he got more ninja) and I never could figure out why the cats were always acting like they hand eaten that day (Ollie on counter while I was in the shower).
You got me
Where can I find this chant?
That is fantastic and sounds delightful
^^ awesome wedding story lol
Thanks man, was wonderful indeed.
:p
Run away
Look up some breathing techniques. By training yourself to respond to certain emotional factors with a change in breathing pattern you can lessen even revert back out of it. Might be something to look into. I would also recommend meditation and quitting smoking (guess). Funny thing about the cigs that most users will say smoke cause of stress, much of the stress is cig related, addiction and all.
Ugh, so jelly it's your last semester. Get it girl.

Already written to several reps imploring to embrace medical, at the very least, and consider jumping on for legalization to be on the front curve of the thousands of cannabis business and research into future potential of the plant, plus quoted the $5 mill in sales from the first week in Colorado, plus the Gacare conference call.
It's possible, even likely, it is a small world after all.
Nice lol
^^ ate my beano last night else I woulda lol.
It was a wild time for sure
miss you brah, i'm sure the wee tot taking loads of time. love to you and your fam
how DARE you madame... :P
Interestingly enough Hoffman lived to the ripe old age of 102 having eaten .25 miligrams or 2500 hits of LSD. This man continued to give science years of dedicated work after his insane ride, without thinking himself as a cup of orange juice. Just saying if there WAS a perma trip possible (seriously don't say a friend is a glass of OJ without newspaper article to back it), Hoffman would have been the one stuck.
Thanks hommie :)
Thanks man, hope all is well on the western coast.
Thanks my dear, shoulda been here boozin it up with me dawg.
Holy crazy lol.
Certain rules need to be followed, but there are subtle ways to invoke a sense of dread with simply your cuts and the way you splice it all together.
Sounds, lighting but the cuts and shots are more important than you would think.
Thanks Debbie. :) hope all is well with y'all, miss the heck outta ya
Thanks Patty, starting off quite well indeed.
Beer you can chew
How do YOU know what I look like in a bikini?
I could be game
Thanks man, miss the late night tea sessions with you and Winn. It's been far too long.

That's why I snagged my can and started recording. It literally was ranting sideways and I thought a funnel had dropped. Didn't last long here though.

Interestingly enough a dietician went out to prove it's not WHAT you eat, but what you do that creates the most change. His diet was terrible, chips, pizza, McD, etc. yet through calorie counting and carefully making sure he burned more calories through exercise and sexercise (who are we kidding it's great cardio) than he was taking in. The man lost weight. The real diet is stop eating crap and get up off your chunky butt and exercise daily.
Why choose to let a little thing like a little rain dictate how you feel?
Love right back dawg
Cheating the bday is better than showing up first day of class still drunk.
Awesome present :)

I know you both and just hear you protest, yet quietly yearn for just that. *rolls eyes*
^^ yes it's extrovert and I'm an odd mix. I love my chill time at home, but am comfortable being the life of the party too. Perhaps it was years of restaurant/bar work, boarding school (it was like having 50 brothers and 30 sisters), or a life of being a gypsy and traveling the country, meeting new people.
Aidan is correct, skinny dipping is a way of life here. Totally was out in Az , too.

My neighbors know better than to look at my sliding glass door as they walk past so probably not much.

I was naked for like 60% of my college orientation.
I know what it means... Binoculars in the bushes :p
Becky, what makes you think I haven't been found naked in a tree?
It's my average day usually lol
Right there with ya dude.
You already live in Mexico (or what used to be Mexico till we violently took it from them).

We started IN the tree house Tammy, she got nailed through the floor ;)
Yup, so tiny I only have to roll it twice so I don't drag on the floor *sad face*
Texas should be given back to Mexico.

so you made Jones bone sticky did you
That is simply gorgeous.
Pshh, I nailed her so hard she thought she put her clothes on AND had the taxi drop her at home.

Right, first time in some of our lifetime that legal weed could be bought by anyone, how many people do you think made new years travel plans simply so they could be in Colorado for opening day. yes the numbers will be high still, but you can expect a decline in the revenue as the novelty wears off (and as more states follow suit).
remember, with 60+ years of prohibition people are chomping at the bit to be there for the first sales. These numbers will more than likely drop down by at least half in the first 1/4 of the year.
^^ these numbers wont be steady accurate.
I hear you get loads of $$. $250k a kidney n stuff.

Can't have one without the other. A hater has to care enough about your life to hate you for what you do with it.
Texas will likely never be liberal enough to go with that idea, it'll have to see federal first. Sadly the same is true with Ga, legal weed will likely be up for federal before or with the next presidential election then they can't do much lol.
Totally cool man, love it.
It's not a flat tire light, it's a tire Preasure. With the cold the air in your tires will shrink and a tire moderately low will slip even lower on the spectrum. Get to a Quicktrip and fix that, ice + low tire = bad day.

Sadly her role from comic to show is a bit diff. Comic govey raped the fuck out of her in the room next to Glen, beat her, brutalized her, fucked her world up. Govey DESERVED every bit of what she gave him, I find her character a little off putting in the show as she was just a violent aggressor cause her useless ex-gf spread her legs for what seemed a better deal. Not so much a character you feel for, however I love the comic Michone and have to hope that as they get more to the comic story, as we saw in the mid-season finale, they bring her character closer to the mysterious badass who you hope to see make it out of tight scrapes. Seriously, pick up a few volumes of the comic, or download the app and purchase a digital copy, as I did (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-walking-dead/id395985060?mt=8)

Cops operate on the same level gangs do. Catch the cop alone and he's a pussy that'll just get back in his car and summon more boys with guns. When the group is there, it's all "I'm fucking Superman, time to show off for my bros." Gangsters are the same, terrified without their hommies, tis why they are always in fight or flight mode ;-)

So jelly
I watched Ollie inject 4 last night, thought he was gonna OD n everything. His ass is goin to doggy rehab he is.

it's a shame that more people don't know this info, to.
your really reaching with this one were perfectly fine without all the stupid english lessons... ;-)
where is this?
It may be time to pull out my waffle maker and whip up some batter.
Yeah, I really wanna be getting out and rock climbing a good bit more.
Pimptastic piece. If you're ever in the market for moldivite from the 20g to i believe one 44g piece, let me know :-P
Chows are designed for it, it probably feels bettef to him than being indoors. Friend had a malamute that was about the same way. You call him and he roll his eyes and go lie down in a snow drift.
Woot, glad you had fun dawg
Hahaha.
Holy awesome bad looking idea :)
Lol yup
Kinda like the kid in Phoenix who was arrested for practicing ROTC maneuvers in the desert with his airsoft gun. Two ladies called it in freaking out and he got bombarded by swat and charged with misconduct even though it's beyond legal to own and carry your weapon in Az.

Edit: airsoft gun only fires rubber bullets with air pressure, it's not even a technical gun. As far as I know, the kid was found guilty.
Gypsy is jealously looking over my shoulder. She misses her old friend snow.
^^ medal of honor vote here
^^^ bingo. The man IS a patriot in everything that our forefathers voiced and wrote to want for patriots. To be a patriot is not to just go along with what the government wants, it's to look out for everyone, even from the government (if need be). The hope isn't to need to look out for the people FROM the government, but to have the right to protect yourself from tyranny and violation of a way of life that was decided as "equality." Snowden is more a patriot than any man or woman in this country. He risked his life, and if the media holds any truth the lives of those he loved, to ensure that the population knew of the illegal use of resources the government was using while lying to the average Joe.
I'll pop him into my itunes to get list
He is casper the fucking ghost compared to most of his co-stars in the hop of the hip.
Right, but consider the "guilty" bit put in terms even folks of low IQ can understand. Remember to spread a message it must be easily digestible to the public, many of whom have been, know someone, or have family in jail or is now out.
^^ I didn't even know who that was till now.
I'll happily pay the tax not to have to look over my shoulder to smoke a doobie.

In other words, any guy who practices game and is totally cool with friend zoning is already doing exactly this. It's nothing new, stupendous, or even game, it is simply the inevitable result if you keep lady friends around. I also feel like I read something similar in one of the Strauss books years ago.

"STEP 3: OUTSOURCE THE WHOLE PROCESS After several approaches, you’re going to become increasingly more lazy (if you’re anything like me). So what I’ve actually ended up doing now is outsourcing the whole process to my girls. They approach, open, build rapport, comfort, get contact details, friend on Facebook, invite the girls out and all I do is just wait for the perfect time to get introduced and boom, that’s it. Cool huh?" = weak sauce IMO.

Kim which news group do you prefer? Fox, the creators of the Kenyan birth certificate lie. CNN, who lied about the Boston marathon recently (exposed by John Stewart)? Or one of the others I've left out?
And if bush rigged an election, TWICE (I refuse to believe we were that dumb the second time) what would you call an election where one candidate openly hates on women, animals, and minorities, while the other is a minority and a very well spoken guy not pouring hate. Cause if ANYONE thought Romney was gonna win after all that they need to share whatever they are on, it's clearly really good.

No, so ends the beginning.

Right, cause Christians have been so persecuted through out the ages with the Spanish Inquisition, the crusades, the Dark Ages, clearly Hitler picked on them, as did the Egyptians, also the Native Americans, African tribes, and anyone that doesn't look like them/believe the same shit. Cause we're all at war with xmas *scary boogyman face*
The video I saw of the program I went to had kids on horseback and roasting marshmellows over a campfire. Within 5 minutes of being there i had 4-6 large (two body building brothers, 1 ex army ranger, an ex cop, and an angry Irish guy) surrounding me and screaming at the top of their lungs, waiting for me to react physically (push my way out or take a swing) so they could toss me on the ground and physically restrain me. This was just the first of 4 such places my folks subjugated me to.

The Times cover picture from then sold it for me... If you look carefully (and have a hard copy of the magazine, the photo seems to have vanished from the net) the plane isn't aero-dynamic, there is a random lump on the bottom of the fuselage, which we also know no Boeing model possesses. I want to see the truth of the incident come out, both the Bin Ladin families and the Bush families brought up on their war crimes and Osama really found and publicly executed. With a majority of the council that made up the 9/11 official story having come out and lied, INCLUDING the dude that owned the towers, I don't know why we haven't already witch hunted their asses.
One last note... boeing 757 are 44' 6" tall, not 12.25' (again from the wiki)
Also, how could the fuselage go into a perfectly round hole without any indication of there having be a tail on the plane (which ALL planes have).
^^ That hole is still not 128' across (wingspan of a 757 pulled from Boeing 757 wiki) and about where that "no parking" sign is... SHOULD have wing impact... Last I checked 757 wings don't fold up inside the plane at the push of a button.

Congratulations :)
Right, but oj has not been a rich fuck since he got away with murdering people and had to declare bankruptcy. Then writing stupid "if I did it, here's how" and THEN gets caught robbing a sports memorabilia store. Rich folks don't do the dirty work themselves Jason, they have someone do it for them. Oj did NOT go to prison when he wa rich, nor did MJ, or any of those molesting priests (that I know of). Wesley Snipes went to prison for not paying taxes for a while, I believe he owed multiple millions of dollars. Ironic since John Carey probably owes WAY more than that, once you factor in all his foreign accounts that are tax free. The bottom line is, Wesley got the public figure spanking for committing a crime while black (the same crime I'm sure Trump commits on a much larger scale).
^^ and did both again ;)

Apparently you forgot that we fucked up SAUDI ARABIA first and hung their dictator, who we found in a hole in the ground. Y'all really dropped the ball on that one. Especially when there is so much information out there that can link 9/11 to the Bush family. Like perhaps the Bush family and the Bin laden family own a majority of the company that has produced our weapons of war. Or the molten slag in the basement, burning hotter than jet fuel burns, found a week AFTER the attack via thermal scan. Even 5/6 of the council members that created the official 9/11 report have come out and said they lied, INCLUDING THE OWNER OF THE TOWERS.

Yeah, my eyes sprung a weird link too dude.
Yeah dude, know the feeling. congress has had something like 11-12 raises since our last minimum wage hike. Those fucks make over $130k a year, which apparently isn't enough for living expenses, yet expect regular folks to get by with $7.25 an hour. They are out of control. Frankly I think they'll legalize cannabis federally before they change any minimum wage standards. Why? If the population can't find their feet and just wants a fucking Twinkie they won't revolt... Right?

I agree with children rapists, cause it takes irrefutable evidence to put them away however there have been MANY innocent people on death row, plus that constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. If that wasn't a law, I'd say mandatory sex changes for men who commit rape (yes women do it too) and THEN put them in prison at a reduced sentence (less time taxpayers pay 400k/year for their ~15k-20k or less living expenses (shite food, minimal electricity, gas and water consumption).

I must have misunderstood your earlier comment about major lawsuit, Sam.
What y'all say on my profile in reply does NOT reflect my actions, thoughts, feelings, etc. Asking who's got liability is NOT a lawsuit, it is a request for one business or the other to accept the responsibility for damages that clearly one of them needs to.
In fact, Sam you are the only one who brought up lawsuit under if it had fallen on a kid. Just sayin.
I never said anything about a lawsuit (other than if it had hit me, they'd be uber boned). As I have called both site management, who hired the crew, and the crew's home base asking who's got liability. Management said they were sending someone ~2 hours ago, still waiting

All I know is that I've heard Jeremy's name dragged through the mud by many of the people in this very group for over a year. As this is the first such comment I've heard from him (don't get me wrong, I don't really hang out with him and deff don't chat ever), I'm just going to say that everyone has a breaking point. With as fast as Charles' post reached the people it was directed at, I'm gonna bet the probability is that Jeremy all out knows the stuff said behind his back, or at least some of the sentiments shared. Is he right to take his frustration out in a public setting, no, however it may have just been when he decided to let the shit said behind his back get the better of him.

^^ I haven't had any issues with Ambler (possibly why he mentioned me in a positive light). I do have to say that I have heard lots of badmouthing of other walkers, and not one positive thing about Jeremy, behind their backs in this very group (yes I have taken part in some of it myself and am guilty too). Frankly, the attitude and large head LOTS of people get astounds me, we are ALL uncredited EXTRAS.

Tim, quit feeding into the stupidity. We all saw Koske blow a gasket, threaten to sue over a fan using his photo with a self given nickname. This shit should have stopped a year ago, let him be upset for Koske being kinda a dick about it, he has every right to be. IDK about the stuff with either of the other two mentioned, but well remember the other incident.
Yeah, but you get a perfectly good 'straw' to suck your nourishment through ;)
I volunteer to "drink from the trough" ;)
LMFAO... yup... i feel a decided shift in this post... Folks, let's stop the hating on each other and just have a laugh.
I mean, if we really want to get into it, the likelihood of a man named Jesus traveling with 12 disciples while performing miracles is about 0 chance of containing any factual truth behind it. There were many historians of the age and the only ONE that made any note of 'Jesus' was proven to be a forgery by the Catholic church, sometime during the Dark Ages (a time we can exclusively thank Christianity for). That being said, if Jesus ever DID feed thousands of people with 32 fish, that would be like uber headline news of the time, aka EVERY historian would want to cover it. Factually speaking, Jesus may have existed, but he was no more than you or I. That is to say just a regular man used in storybook to impart what society considered important moral teaching, NOT act as historical "fact." The fact that there are 15+ religions predating Christianity, with the exact same "died for three days and was thus resurrected" mythos to the story means we must look further into why that particular time/resurrection was so popular. Once we have looked at it, we find that the Sun does a funny thing and appears to stop moving in the sky for ~ 3 days (location dependent) then begins to rise in the sky again. Now this is interesting when you factor in the 12 disciples that Jesus traveled around with, there are 12 astrological signs (and have been for longer than the Jesus myth). So, in literal translation Jesus is the SUN (yes i meant the burning ball of gas in the sky) of 'god,' and still to this day travels with his 12 disciples, just not in a human and flesh kind of way. This means Jesus was neither black, yellow, red, green, or blue, but is in fact a brilliant golden color that is REALLY hard to look at (Galileo taught us why while locked up during the Inquisition). The photo above is merely a picture of what Aramaic (Those of Middle Eastern descent) people of the time looked like.

Frankly, I'd love to see ALL Us politicians investigated for war crimes, treason, neglect, and whatever else someone is creative enough to look for and catch.
Obama did a great job of dusting Bush's dirt under the carpet.
yeah, he got paid quite well for his service to the Bush family.
I have 0 doubt that man is still alive and likely living in the lap of luxury, here in the United States. Have you SEEN the Bin Laden mansion outside of Boston? You know, the one that they vacated from while all other flights where grounded, flown out of on Air Force One. So he can't be Bin Laden any more, that doesn't mean he doesn't have a fuckload of money. Take the blame to get us into war where your family owns a majority of the company producing our weapons of war.
It's a pleasure dude. :-D
I totally did :P
Dude, just keep plugging at what you love and sometimes life will shower you with love right back. Good luck with the writing.

Aye, a kick and a half actually :-D
Check out Operation Northwoods, CIA plan to get the US into war with Cuba by hijacking boats, and killing people on the streets. Our government really looks out well for us.
Mine was SUUUUCH a sissy, she was terrified to get in the car the first two rides. I presume much abuse in her past, possibly including a vehicle. Her third ride was exuberant and excited though, then again the second ride was to a swamp area... she had a blast and got FILTHY.

Actually cannabis leaves are a super green and could be used in a salad for a massive nutritional boost. Also, this simple one probably wouldn't be best suited to growing of much more than herbs or carrots, maybe a potato.
Either that or they assume that the American populace is too lazy and stupid to actually do anything. The question is, how willing to shoot citizens will the military be?

Almost better than a trip to jail for exercising your "constitutional rights" plus the fines and shit that go with it. Talk about armed robbery.
No reply in 2 hours... Not well me thinks lol
perfectly stated :p
That is freakin awesome
Aye, but the concept of "private property" and public domain is rapidly changing to push out those exercising their legal right to "peacefully assemble." In the time I have been attending protests, sidewalks have gone from public domain to owned by the person/business thwt they are in front of, thereby making a fundamental right that once made this country great very abusable. In fact, often the arrests used to condemn the movement are spawned from such nonsense and don't stand up in court.
There are now both Emma
Yes. Despite the "safety" assurance, I'm betting they are terribad for you, day glow too
Who got his wings ripped off for wanting a different way of life... Isn't that what we strive to do on a daily basis, change the shitty system into something better for majority? So in that regaurd who do you trust, the guy fucked up for fighting, or the giant who ripped the fly's wings off?

Sorry you are sick Katharina, get some soup and some rest.
Willfully pretending something you don't like doesn't exist is dangerous, especially when it's a train of thought, belief's or ideals. Without the willing participation from folks that looked the other way (yes they choose to look the other way rather than say there was something wrong) we wouldn't have had the Nazi's or KKK or any other such group of idiots that followed what another idiot said without the use of thought.

Without a doubt they are going to learn a harsh lesson about gravity and what the feathers they need to grow are for. Good form though.
^^ also a guy who robbed 4 banks at gun point had a 2.5 year sentence, the same sentence I had to beg forgiveness for having a two day old joint in my system while behind the wheel, to avoid.
The problem is fighting against the felons can't vote bit. As cannabis tends to get the user a felony, they have 7 years where they can't help out. This time can easily grow if you aren't likely to vote in the manner your state favors. Take this last presidential election for instance. I got my right to vote back a year prior, for the cannabis related "crime" of having smoked a joint two days prior to driving. The week of the election, I got a note saying my voter registration wouldn't go through as I didn't have it back. In short, I got extended due to the way I would have likely voted. The system is flawed and designed to leave as much of the population unable to do anything about it as possible.
Wow Siri,
It would be more impressive if they were at the grocery storype with that.

Also, I don't give a fuck about being early on the deadline. Friday gives me lots of not giving a fuck time to get-r-done.

Bring it and be prepared to make cloth bets :p
Today, I'm your phlebotomist, sit back, relax and OOOOPS...
They look like my boys damn
Clearly you haven't read the books. ;)
That is now on my bucket list :)
Depending on the type of seasoning lovely portabellas like that can totally be a magical experience.
Out in Colorado huh?
No problem dude
Also, you bringing it is showing you give a fuck about winning :p point one useless Yank ;)
:)
See me not giving a fuck how brought it is...
I had one of those for a minute, it worked pretty well, figured I could reduce my financial impact by just going quitter.
^^ How did you guess I was ship wrecked on a deserted idle?
Me too
If you get them, I want pictures lol

Group: Atlanta Lair
Brilliant taking it to campus tomorrow, will have video coming up too :)
hehe, Steve rocks
mine doesn't either ;-)
Thank you for sharing. Loves it :)
awww, yall look so cute together... I think she already has one :P
I mean, it wouldn't be the first time a woman convinced me to wear her clothes for Halloween, went as a battered hooker one year. I still think I got the good end of the deal, let's just say the payout was totally worth it.
O
Yeah, this one is a total pussy, he would not to honor to a strong name like that.
Yall gots a weird thanksgiving date, however I like the Turkey two months in a row bit :P
They do not air their training exercises, period. To have the clearance for specifics such as locations, times, specifics etc, you gotta have high clearance.
#chomp :)
Top not too, thanks again for all your stellar fuck ups Siri.
I was in Vermont, my first day at a new school and happened to have a teacher wanting to show a video, the television was on the news channel. First hit was reply, second was live. Yes I believe "terrorists" attacked, I just refuse to believe the person blamed is 100% at fault. How would he know the US military's training plan that matched his attack perfectly without inside help at a pretty high (if not too level?
Also, I'm sorry an acquaintance was lost, I just shoot for actual justice on the responsible parties, whom I believe live in Texas.
Aye, but if a government is willing to work with a family of "terrorists," get them away before they are questioned, while they make billions (along with the other major family in play) questions need to be raised. With 5/6 of the official committee coming out and saying they lied, further questions must be raised. No coverage on Osama's death, other than the assertion of the same lying government (regime change cannot reflect the illegal nature of the "war" spawned or our allies won't be "allies" much longer), don't you question things as a philosopher?
True on the windows account, missile or plane alike. However the first photo release (which I literally cannot find anymore), showed spools of cable, next to the impact (before the top collapsed) still fully intact. These spools would have been where wings would be, yet undisturbed.
Yes, I did hunt them out ;)
A planes engine has the pore to knock another plane out of the air, yet it didn't cause a single car accident as it passed over a busy highway? Let alone the pilot would have had to have flown it 2' above the ground at +500 mph? I took my freshman year in the same town those two pilots allegedly went to flight school in, the professors that taught them to say they weren't great pilots and could not have succeeded in that feat.
I am a science nerd, watched it live and had my first day at a new school traumatized. I have researched the shit out of this, there is literally 0 possibility that the "official" story is true, 5/6 of the comitee have now said they lied (including the owner of the towers).
I was in boarding school, first day in fact, after ALL flights got grounded I had a 747 fly over me as it was taking the Bin Laden family (previously living in Boston, I have been to their old house) out of the country. Police SOP, question family, not get them out of dodge.
^ totally common for a regular 747, right?
Yes I realize that leaves the pentagon out, however planes have wings, wings would be part of the damage to building, interior or exterior. Wings were not found exterior, so they MUST have folded in like a transformer before impact.
If you can believe that the two families that stood the most to gain from this (Bush and Bin Laden, who own a majority of the company that produced our weapons from war) may have ties (Bush Senior sitting with Bin Laden representative watching it live) then it all starts to fall to place. Not to mention the molten slag burning hotter than jet fuel, noticed a week after the attack, questions get raised. Also if pancake theory is to be believed (aka floor gets heated falls into next, etc. why were support beams not left in the aftermath?)

http://www.truthin7minutes.com/september-11-hoax-the-truth-about-the-911-hoax
http://www.rense.com/general70/3o.htm
Another site (German) again no wings having impacted.
http://www.rense.com/general70/3o.htm
Le sigh, fine... I'll hunt out the buried photo, first released that leaves no doubt a plane never hit. (Seriously well hidden from a simple search)
I mean, it's a pretty shite run for us here. Miley and Brittany are role models, what do you expect from us? Don't you kinda wanna hit BOTH?
^ I do :)
Also still smaller than a 747 :)
That is the exterior shot, see the no parking sign, still in tact where a wing would have destroyed it

Show, long before I had anything to do with them.
Damned straight; my fav ago
Also physically impossible to fly a 747 2' above the ground at over 500mph, let alone not knock the morning traffic off the highway with an engine powerful enough to take another plane outta the air :)
Tower 7, too low to be hit by anything, left out of the report entirely.
I don't seriously believe that "terrorists" hijacked the planes the first time and if they did, they clearly had help from inside. The US Airforce has had a 100% success rate of grounding hijacked planes except for that one day. Their failure was due to a "training exercise" of the exact same specifications. Instead of three planes, they had 37 possible planes, only 3 of which existed. Simulation and reality could not be separated, so planes hit the towers. Interestingly, the floor superheated, fell into the one below it, etc, yet no support beams were left standing? Non of the "facts" add up and most of the 9/11 committee that came up with the official story have confirmed they lied (5/6 I believe).
Haven't gotten that far along in the project. Gots to get some funds to get training and trips out to start planning scenes and the like.
Colorado
Meet Willow Lake, where I shall be filming before too long :)

Aye, and that is totally appreciated. At the school I am taking classes now, I was able to raise my hand, every class, and tell the teacher why he was lying to me, with current event included. Sadly, I cannot test it of the class :(
That is an outdated saying, back in the day it was true due to refrigeration not being on the level, now that we got good coolers, they stay good year round :)
Holy hellz yeah, where is this dude so I can trike jack him?
That is unfortunately the problem with substance abuse issues. While written into the medical journal as a disease, many would prefer to just lock said person away in jail rather than help them to get better, simply easier that way.
I can't wait to take my first jumpola

Beautiful out there :)
Haha, jokes on you, we woulda starved if you said brains :p
Would you rather us eat your canned food or your brains, can't keep both to yourselves.
Remember, they still have to tread carefully as the federal government is known for raiding state legalized patients, such as the raid on Oaksterdam University. Until it is repealed on a federal level, they must fear repercussions on a federal level (read budgetary). Plus figuring out how to tax the sale must be a unique problem in and of itself.

Of course they have... Government protects it's own and fucks the rest.
Yeah, I LOVED those movies
Sweetness, you ladies have too much fun for me :p

Soak for like 10 min, then try again with vasoline over lotion.
Warm salt water
Yeah, I just figured I'd leave the scary solution outta the picture.
Congrats my dear :)
^^ strong selling point to get those friends he seems to need lol.
I know the anatomy is difficult, but try a saline soak, preferably using sea salt. If it's a gunk issue that'll help loosen it up and it may just come off. Otherwise you'll have to enlist a friend's help and probably use some vasoline

I think you misunderstand the point of a joke to someone going through a hard time. Even just a snort of laughter can be considered an improved mood. :)
I know, freaking awesome right? Can't believe Ga wasn't the first to release, bet people would drive here to get one.
No way, remember how adamant Bush was to get us there to detract from his illegal war? Once someone gets there, we'll likely nuke em for resources.
Just today? I'm still mad I haven't gotten a reach around for the 29 years they've been screwing me. Rich fucks need to care more about the people that pay their check and less about the company financing their election. Sure, we can't contribute millions to the campaign, but a company isn't invested in a person's interests, only how to separate the people from their money more easily.
You are my new hero lol
Super cool.
Boy ain't that the truth
^ it was a joke those of us that attended RPS would get ;)
True, but they had to make it illegal to sue mcdonalds for being fat. Then again, McDonald's shoulda hired better lawyers, I have the winning defense. "Did you pass the second grade?" You know, that year you learn the food pyramid and the info that eating too much x is bad for you. Bam, prior knowledge it was likely to make you chunky monkey. Where my contract Ronald?
Nothing surprising here, citizens are the new "terrorists." Then again, wouldn't congress count as a "terrorist" by causing another government freeze with their greed? "No tax break for the rich AND you want us to pay towards people having insurance? We won't work then."
Yeah, I'm not game for freebe work right now, got too much on my plate.
I imagine one could sue for that little slip with a case of false advertising. Then again, Best Buy still hasn't been sued for being the best buy only in name.

Wow lol good job

Yayo, congratulations :)
Back at Rock Point huh?
Lol, priceless.
What exciting creature are you playing with today?
It's called armed robbery of the American people, not so much dude charged. For every year he spends behind bars, taxpayers can expect to pay $450k to house him in a hotel better suited for rodents than people. For his non-violent offense, he will be put in physical danger and (if lucky) get his cancer treatments (also funded by tax payers). So who really looses out in that legislation?
I blame mass religion for the lack of free thought, personally. Any time belief workout thought comes into the picture I read danger.
We DO live in a country where free thought is massively missing. Whatever the boobs on the tube tell us MUST be true, even though they have all been proven to lie for ratings. Couldn't be bs this time.
We're gonna toss a fit cause we don't get tax breaks for those if us making $150k, are not allowed to cut funding to aid programs for the needy and will have to help people out with insurance for all. Of course the insurance bit means the hospitals will actually get paid for the $41 billion that they annually expect to not get paid for (Forbes), which may increase the funding for them to have the tech to save more lives. Small matter though, they can't buy that new Mazarati *tosses fit.*
Hopefully you used the stove. Crockpots cool amazing meals at the expense of smelling wonderful smells for 8hours before it's ready.
yaya gangsta
Woot, get it girlie.
Less of a concern than the damage we have done to what SHOULD be out god, the earth that factually gives us the food we eat, the air we breath and the water we drink. At the rate we are going, we will see the end of polar ice caps, the extinction of thousands of species and a permanent +6 degree change in global temperatures, all expected within the next 20 years. The question is, can we survive ourselves?
Lol, no way doof.
Congrats.

I know out west the organic food market had it in the dried herb area. Then again, they also sell healing crystals in like 60% of the stores in the towns I lived in lol.
I have some nettle, not sure what happened to my Mullen.
Mullen or nettle tea, not particularly tasty so perhaps mix with a green tea for taste. Mullen helps with respritory, nettle detoxifying the body (mostly liver for blood purification, but would probably help too)
Stomach or lung issue?

Sadly, recorders are the bullies enemy, it is often the crucial evidence that allows people to walk free. As this cuts the $450k per year/per person Uncle Sam extorts for the "care" of those behind bars. Our government is the largest proponent of armed robbery, I trust muggers more.

He didn't freak out like I had hoped, but it did cause some wild stumbling into a fall.
As in it was too dark to get a good video of him with anything but my phone. Problem is the phone was a big light up sign of "Hey, that asshole messing with you... He's over here!!!" The run lights on my camera can have electrical tape tossed on and bam, camera vanish.
When I tossed the fireworks at him, he stood bolt upright, unsteadily moved to the other side of the car, and promptly fell over. Pity the video didnt' work out so well :(
Doin aight, thanks my dear.
I tossed fireworks at him, instead.

Ain't that the truth
Or was this the rare non-joke from you :p
So are you, but we accept you anyways :)
Have fun dude :)
I always thought that when a certain customer came into a certain coffee shop I worked, then bitched like she was surprised when she added 5 things she got charged more. She came in almost daily, bitch enough manager gave her what she wanted.
Thanks dude, right back at ya.
I'm used to it by now, 29 years of this.
You're welcome. People SHOULD be freaked out, enough freaked out people MAY yet change the course of disaster. However it requires the greedy fucks in power to value life over the thickness of their wallet.
Radioactive waste flooding the ocean near Japan, molasses spill offing fish in Hawaii, polar ice caps melting faster than the normal 20% a year, yeah we're pretty set for major disaster.
That's LA for ya, lol
^^ And Atlanta ;)
Go to Korean town and find a restaurant you can't read the menu in. Best Asian food you'll ever have, if you can manage a little communication with a waiter.
Which doesn't necessarily mean I cannot come, it just might mean that surprise guests attend with me.
Wow, what the actual fuck?

Also enough people need to not have felonies that would support it. Sadly, as in many states cannabis is still considered a felony, it makes it a bit difficult.
Georgia is looking into a medical policy, as we speak. Once states in the south start, the rest will follow. Remember, cannabis friendly people out number the rest it just gots to get put on the ballet.
I see acacia, aligator juniper and likely mesquite, yucca is a spikey, low lying shrub, similar to agave. :)

Lol, I was at a New Years party down there one year. It was beyond wild, and yes... They do come from that area, I heard em clear as could be from a nearby neighborhood (smart party hosts paid off duty cop to monitor parking, DEFF wasn't from the party I was at)

I've seen me a thing or two in this wild thing we call life, in fact it wouldn't be the first time I heard gunshots and took a minute to evaluate. Knowing where the source of personal danger is, is a better step than not knowing which of your neighbors is dangerous. As is I know there is danger, just not where from.
I love you Sam
Dragon con biological warfare is tough, ain't it.
Meh, I woulda been fine I'm sure.
Thanks for passing on :)

I mean, the criminals will still have the black market. Remember, we are adamantly fighting against people that make most of their profits from what the US declares illegal. Now wait a minute, wouldn't that mean legalization on multiple fronts would put our enemies fumbling for finances???

The Takeover (Trent) and Beyond the Fire (Taylor)
Which we are kinda run ing out of ~20 years till permanent tempt shift and extreme planetary damage,
Sam I have been mentally using fields of it as a cap on the damage on the amazon rain forest and building/living materials for a bit myself. I actually see it as a viable option as to how we can save ourselves from ourselves, or at least buy ourselves more time.
Yeah but I actually know a couple of folks who work there. Wtf
Idk why people don't just look at how our "enemies" make their money, off the shit we make illegal. How do you crush them, take away all funding coming in. How do you save millions of lives a year, have safe use areas, check in for a fee, get your kick, and have medical professionals on hand. If it is regulated, the money goes to the right place, the sick individual is safe and even the probability of abuse is likely to drop if the lower legal drinking age in Europe is any indication of.
But I'll trade my shit in for diesel and make my own fuel. Biodiesel is relatively easy to make, headed a chemistry project on it at Prescott College.
However still a combustion engine, so will emit greenhouse gas, which is the bigger problem.
And it's a renewable source of paper, clothes, oil, food, medicine... If we all switched to diesel we'd solve one problem and could adapt the car to run entirely off hemp oil. OMG no more disasters like the BP spill.
Remember, these guys have money well beyond what Michael Jackson and Oj had before getting away with some pretty awful shit.
I'd say more likely by foreign banking interests, the same ones that have our government, always in debt. Ever paid a bill late, or worse yet have the nightmare of endless phone calls from collectors? Wonder what it's like when you are beyond however much money is "made" in the hole.
And Adam west was an AWESOME batman, watched the shit out of those as a kid :)
With this sort of outrage, he's likely to get dropped if he under performs, but I'm betting he's going more Adam west style. His terrible style may just nail that one down
I had that argument with a stupid occupy kid, heart in the right place, but terrible foresight.
Yay, zeitgeist is finally seeing more light.
Congratulations to you :) woot woot
All in a days work
So true, although everyone IS talking an awful lot about the movie... Good marketing move.... If he doesn't fail us.... Again.
Yup, sounds like a nightmare
You just stated a paradox, all abortion is a form of contraception, the line there is too grey and puts an opinion on a medical procedure. Not your body, not your fucking choice, simple as that. You don't have to ever even know and all consequences of the action are to the mother (any sickness or mental distress). Why is sovereignty of ones own body even a question, religious reasons only, straight unconstitutional for the law to be in place forbidding it. Plus, lets face it, there and PLENTY of less safe ways to preform a similar thing at home, or in an alley. A desperate person will always find a way, even to their own detriment. Save a valuable member of society, or something that won't give back for a really long time?
Ahh, you kinda like your job huh?
Ipecac, think the family guy episode they yacked for like 5 minutes. Yeah... I hated a job THAT badly, however it gained me a 4 day rock climbing trip to an amazing place. I don't regret it one bit.
Dude... I know how to get out of that, but you won't like it for about an hour after.
I happen to know one or two :)
Woot have fun
Still looking great together. Miss yall.

Wait... He still gets work???
It was surely an interesting afternoon. As I tried to walk to the house to get the cats out, the fireman told me I couldn't go because if it caught, the entire area was likely to blow. was a wild afternoon.
sorry to hear that babe.
And yes there was a school shooting, also not terribly far from me. Crazy day all over Ga.
I hope so too Becky
Aye
I actually will not be able to attend as a guest as I have other obligations that prevent that, sadly.
Mine said right? At the end of all sentences lol
I had one that did that too lol
Get yourself all moved?
I believe that both can be true.
I am a dirty boy, still a little orange stained from all the Ga red clay.
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the kindness of organizations like Food Not Bombs. Being homeless for a winter in Boston is no where near a good place to be, through the help of organizations I was able to make a better life for myself. Seems like a waste not to share the love further.

As for trauma in the past, lots. I hail from an alcoholic adoptive family that has been abusive my entire life. I have found they have made me a much harder person to break down. I spend much of my life laughing and joking and generally trying to bring joy and excitement, everywhere I go. I would say the trauma of my past set me in my path to where I'm headed tomorrow.

I may not support their stance on homosexuality, however their right to have such a stance is the same one that allows you to choose to be against them. As I support that right, one the powers that be will have a hard time fully taking away no matter how much they censor us, I will not stop enjoying the fuck out of some waffle frys (aka the crack cocaine special).

See that's the tricky part about nicotine. Most users will say they smoke because of stress, yet smoking actually causes more stress than it alleviates. Like any addiction, you get your fix, but till your next you are starting a withdrawal period. Nicotine withdrawal is particularly nasty, sure you don't get super sick, but the wind blowing a hat off your head might send you into a emotional mess. The reality is while stress may have made it seem like a good idea, a majority of the stress that fuels the addiction you can owe entirely to nicotine withdrawals.
Probably just as bad.
Would it be in bad taste to say I have been waiting for that day for as long as I can remember?
Group: Reiki
I am really against anything short of cold turkey, simply because you are still getting you drug of choice. Also, cold turkey has a MUCH higher long term success rate. That being said, I did quit once for a year and a half, but went right back after a really bad day that landed me in jail for a DUI 0.00 (very abridged version). Jeep in mind, like any addiction, it will always be there to rear it's ugly head when you least expect it. All you gotta do is 7 days and physical withdrawal is gone. As any Anonymous program will say, "one day at a time." Reaching out for help and getting friends in on your process helps and is a smart move. I might also suggest tallying up how much you smoke (packs per day) and the average cost per week, month and year. The numbers are staggering, I spent ~150/month at a pack per day. Admittedly I was smoking American Spirits that are more spendy, but not by a wide margin. As a college student, I have little money, so $150 is a lot to me. Also set small goals, write em down and put em in a spot where you see them every day. As you pass your goal, cross it off, but leave it hanging so you see your baby step progress. Strength will come as you set and pass your goals. Remember to keep each goal smaller, but culminating in your larger goal. I may not have success in quitting smoking, but I can boast a better track record for getting friends clean from heroin, 5 of six still clean 5 years later. Feel free to add me and hit me up if you are having trouble. I'm about to undergo the same process with my pipe, so likely helping you will ultimately help me to make the plunge (quit date is at the end of the semester).

E-cigs just gave me a worse habit. The first night I had one I went through the equivalent of 5 packs. Quitting after that was way tough, I might also add I failed. Recently I tried switching my cig addiction to a pipe, broke the cig habit, soon to try to break from a diff medium. I will say I went through the withdrawal, even still getting the nicotine. Tobacco is a hell of a drug.
Right? Those bastards.
It's called evolution. Us dreamers, misfits, mystics etc are displaced by time. Today we are looked at as black sheep, tomorrow we will be those that posed a new way.
Frankly, I'm holding on to a basic right that is getting destroyed faster ever day, freedom of speech. Black bag me, bitches. Like obi-wan, I'll just come more powerful than they can possibly imagine... Your move Big Brother.

Also, good luck, cigs are more addictive than heroin (science fact) probably kill more people yearly too (don't have statistics for that one)

Frankly I thought it would keep the entire post that came with it, explaining. Yay FB for sometimes keeping original post, sometimes not. Seriously, why is the movie about Zuckerburg, he's NOT a great programmer, it's his marketing friend that is the REAL genius.

It's hard to believe ANYONE drinks folgers, that stuff is terribad.
Bad day, huh? ;-)
Meh, dat was one of two terrible exs. However ladies seem to have sticky fingers when it comes to break up and favorite articles of clothing. Lost many an awesome sweatshirt that way.
Literally every semester I have been in school there at least one class does that crap. Admittedly in my writing class a girl wrote an online reading reply without capitalization, punctuation and mostly in Ebonics or some for of non-English, hood speak. Not sure how she got past 2nd grade, let alone into college. Considering that we ant dealing With the best and brightest there... Well you get the gist.
Woot, high five singles club :)
I always answer that one with "because I have a LOT more fun in my average week than you do, enjoy blow jobs and sex, and don't wanna have to deal with someone else's bad day, when I'm having one. Enjoy your misery." ;-)
If it weren't so funny, his death would be sad... And here's your Dawin Award Peter.
I WAS gonna end it with "ok, back to work, rant is over" or a "*steps off soap box."
Those two emotions are super closely linked, to hate someone you have to care enough about them to be bothered by their actions..
Although Bozeman is freaking awesome :)
Dislike... Friends don't let friends drink Sbux. Shitty unethical coffee, from a company pretending to give a damn about the environment. I know that in Ga, they recycle cardboard, and toss the 15+ trash bags of empty milk containers (daily). What is green about recycling the biodegradable and tossing the shit that takes thousands of years to break down. Sbux is literally killing the environment. Then stop and ponder this doozy, one coffee tree will produce ONE pound of coffee, per year. Can they really be implementing sustainable farming practices at that rate? Not likely. You are WAY better off going to the little mom and pop coffee shop instead. :)
Looks terrible, I'm jelly.
Stupid exs taking the best stuff that doesn't belong to them.
I know the feeling, my Indy hat is the second of its kind (first wasn't official Indy replica). Wore it daily for 8years or so, sad day when it vanished.
^^also, as we took over Iraq to setup a government in our particular type, we probably have deals with them, likely that we won that world domination bit... Until enough countries get tired of our greed to invade American soil. Perhaps why our government planted a bomb in Boston and murdered two children.
But there's it's a lot about taking food from other colonies, we shoot folks to make Iraq more efficient in oil production. (NY Times front page article)
Yes, they are vicious little beasties.
Ummm, yummy :)
Lots of people sharing breakfast huh?? Giggity ;)
I mean, can you think of a time in your life when you didn't hear about murder, war or some foreign "conflict?" Unless soylent green has been manufactured and I don't know about it... That's for greed.
Really? At Disney? Nifty
Weird... It's hot as shit here, you Aussies are backwards :p

I am a creature of the earth and recognize that factually it gives me the food I eat, the water I drink and the air I breath, as such, it is god and needs to be treated as such. With 20 years left till we have indefinitely changed the environment, killed all arctic species, melted the polar ice caps, and like thousands of other species that need colder weather, it is time to stop fighting over which invisible man in the sky is real and band together as a species and start looking at how we a going to survive ourselves.
Holy crap, apparently I wasn't too stuck in books to avoid all photos at that school :p

My home defense is a katana, one in every room. As I sleep in the buff, breaking in to my house will get you a small, naked, white boy running at you with a sword (viable military tactic in years long past)
Also, at least he is protecting the elderly, our failing school system, and those with prior diagnosis of terminal disease. Obama care is the only reason two of my friends are able to get their cancer treatment, wanna speak out against it your an asshole and meet me on the b-ball court to get your ass whooped.
The real question is why isn't the Bush family been executed for their war crimes, taking over a country that had done nothing to us, had a 12 year buried nuclear program that was decades away from being dangerous, just to make Iraq the country wi the highest rate of oil production (Ny Times headline within the past week). Now Pakistan, where there is the largest supply of valuable minerals that we are running out of, yet need for computer production. (Times magazine don't remember the year I read that)
We overtook it, just now... However have had a LOT more time in the contest. That photo averages over 100 votes a day. They have a brutal marketing campaign, or the contest is rigged.
Please invite everyone you know to join, share it out on all social media platforms. I think people will totally vote as a "congratulations you are expecting" gift. ;-) Include that in your posts and it'll likely get hte max number of clicks. I'm gonna be more aggressive and send a morning and evening (Michael) make sure I don't forget... Stressin bs with school (financial aid aint coming in right)
Vj's marketing strategy is SUPER solid, they seem to average over 100 votes a day. We have to pick up our game to pull this one off, or the "contest" is rigged.

Right, the crap in the fruit is PRIOR to brown sugar (turbinado) being added, after its basically just sugared to the max
As an ex-employee of Smoothie King, I can verify... Not one of their "fresh" fruits is In fact fresh. They all come from a can, sugared to a large extent, and then with syrup added. The bottom line is all the sugar and preservatives remove most of the value to their drinks... They are not very good for you, in actuality.

Yup, cause sodium chloride is SUUPER good for you * facepalm*

Boston was just training for declaring martial law and taking over a home town (can you tell me when they have EVER simulated that?)
Our military already proved it was expecting war on home turf by faking doing the Boston "bombing," using paid actors and navy seals (part of the bomb "training") carrying the only bag matching the bomb. One of the "terrorist" children had white, the other grey, neither of which had the white tag on the top (again like the navy seal carrying the black back, wite tag). This just says that shit is expected to hit the fan. With a government, in power, who's past makes Hitler look kind (genocide of 100 million native Americans), a recent war declared violating NATO sanctions, it's only a matter of time before the world is sick of our shit.
Troy, should we not remember the fun we had over the trauma of much of the stupid shit we dealt with? Honestly, being in prison was a step up.

Dumb girls however give a fuck about science, but I give a fuck about them. I want a woman that is smarter than I am and has something to give back, other than what I can achieve, with less effort myself. Also, reading IS learning from people better than you, good enough to earn millions of US $ for writing it. Practice is required either way. Don't box yourself into just what's local, learn everything you can. We're in the school of life gentlemen, learning stops when we are dead.

Ex wife got the crap kicked out of her by her previous BF, for not getting back with him. He kicked her car, shoved her, and even hit her. The police, when called, refused to even come to the scene as she did not have bruises or serious damage to the car. The ex bf was never arrested, charged or any of it. Just a "we can't do anything for you."
Even encouraged. As someone that went to jail, and ultimately prison for a dui, after blowing a 0.00 and while 100% sober (yes I had thc in my system from two days prior) and convicted, with only the profiling of my dreadlocks as "evidence," prior to the warrant for my blood and urine. I know first hand exactly how out of control the "justice" system is and exactly what is left for "cons" getting back out. Job applications tossed away in favor of someone that doesn't have to put in they have made a mistake. Basically, the options to feed themselves or their families become exactly what got them in jail in the first place, or working 3 dead end, minimum wage jobs. Small wonder the recitivism rate is through the roof.
No, he should get the medal for going above and beyond to help a man in need. The color of his skin made it even more unique, I usually witness civil rights abuse in those instances.
Also, he is a Sherrif, not a mechanic. Changing a tire is WAY out of the basic job description of a police officer. This kind soul, is taking a job that is not his, to serve that poor man stranded on the side of the road. Every time I've had a flat, the cop that stops, demands ID, insurance, etc as if I have done something wrong by having an issue with my vehicle. He went far beyond his job description and should get a medal for his dedication to doing the right thing.

DUDE!!!
Never said that all were, but it is a prevalent theme. If you want to argue that, go to any of the local detention centers and count white faces to black. Overall, the population is decidedly skewed. Does that mean that the cop is racist, not necessarily, however if the propensity for searching the black man's pockets, over the white mans (I promise there are just as many white users as black in this city/state) means that the black man is more likely to go to jail than the white, that is system wide racism, end of story.
"I am on GA. I am law enforcement." is that not what you said?
Honestly, I wouldn't want your job, you couldn't pay me enough. Yall have it very rough, as a majority of the people you see in the day, get a panicked feeling from the interaction. The level of consternation that cops get as a whole is astronomical and it's not yalls fault the "law" is designed to protect the rich. OJ and MJ taught us that, with millions of $$ you can kill or rape and get away with it. The level of shadiness the Catholic church is capable of with they're pile of gold scares me.
Also, as white people, we have a proud heritage of systematically destroying EVERY culture that is not ours. Frankly, we deserve the amount of racism that we get, from every culture that ever gives it to us. However, that does not mean that our abuse of everyone else should continue. As Americans our "proud" heritage that we are supposed to be "patriotic" about includes a genecide that made Hitler look like a chump (100 million native americans), we got our proud start off the hard work of an unpaid, mistreated peoples (slavery) and still practice this same "slavery" (15-50c jobs in prison) with a majority of the incarcerated population being from the "minority" group. That being said, why should I support a system that has ALWAYS run off the principal of taking advantage of another culture.
Although that line does give a really good look into the "us vs them" mentality of the Georgia police department.
I'm betting in a situation of dire need, any police officer would commit a crime over seeing their family go hungry. The "asshole" criminal you are talking about is just that, someone who is having a hard time. Also, a majority of the people in the clink are there for the disease of addiction, without any violent offense to justify locking them away.

Woot, reminds me of Costa Mesa :P
Well it was somewhere near you then, there is at least ONE man with a gun NOT out to get you.
Probably around Suwanee or Braselton one of the local Sherrifs. I was hauling so didn't get a good look at the car, just noted that it was the officer putting on the gentleman's tire, while he stood and watched.
about 20 miles north of Lawrenceville, no clue what town it actually was.
Was also cool to see that Rodney Clemons, who was my teacher, is one of your notable visitors. Small world.
again... I can pull statistics ;)
If the government actually took care of ALL areas, instead of sending the school budget to higher income areas (read white neighborhoods) then perhaps the racial diversity of the crime wouldn't be a problem. :-D
I mean, if I lived in a poor income area, with shitty schools that don't have the budget they need to even have the classroom materials, I would probably be in a position where pulling a gun on someone for their money seems like a good idea. When it's how am I going to eat today, 3 hots and a cot is called improvement.
nice work brother.
I think we can also argue that so many states going legal, or medical with cannabis would be a more than valid reasoning for the drug rate to have gone down. Since, even with 15 years of medical proof that cannabis is a strong medicine and hold vast medical use, the stigmata of schedule 1 is nothing more than protecting an industry that kills more than ALL street drugs combined. I am, of course, referring to the pharmaceutical industry here... and again... I have statistics to back me up ;-)
"In other words, the arrest rate for Blacks was more than double that of Whites. At this point, researchers are unsure whether this trend will hold as crime continues to decline.

Violent offenses fell 3.8 percent and property crime decreased 0.5 percent in 2011 compared to 2010. Drug arrests plummeted 6.57 percent, but still account for 1.5 million arrests." for those that don't want to read the entire article.
^^ article above says something different... country wide.
Also, here's an article with statistics to back up my original post. http://sacobserver.com/2012/11/fbi-statistics-show-crime-down-but-black-arrests-up/

Also, is the non-white person you were talking about a badge carrying member of the team?
No, but I watched a cop harassing a black delivery biker for Jimmy Johns who was returning from a delivery. The cop had him in cuffs for over an hour, directly across from his place of employment. In the end, no arrest or ticket was made. That is a 100% illegal detainment and search procedure.
Jim would you like statistics or personal experience to validate what on saying. Also, do you live in ga and are you yourself an officer?

I have been doing a lot of research on social media marketing and saw an insider bit talking about some badass new changes coming up. I have been keeping an eye on it, since. Looks like it is still in semi-beta, not full transfer over. I can add bands to a playlist, however not yet start the music from the search. Inside the playlist if plays flawlessly though :-D.

I mean, some of their rules are pretty good, but I break the hell out of them and come out with a fantastic result. The only solid rule I saw was don't press on it with the spatula. Sure it makes the awesome flame up, but you have just dropped all the yummy grease and flavor simply made the fire flare. Smoking is also fine, however most use hickory or oak, which IS too strong a flavor to accompany a burger. Peach, pecan or apple add a LOT of value to the overall taste. Mushing I do, but only because I pop two patties together with a little pocket full of cheese and goodness, without compressing the proteins down and making the burger a little less tender, they fall apart. However, the added grease from the cheese melting inside the burger, seems to replace the tenderness, and add massive flavor. Then again, I am a rule breaker and risk taker, so rather adventurous in my culinary creations.

They may or may not reflower, I would suggest a round of nutrients designed to boost the flowers in plants. You can probably find a liquid at any hydroponic store that will fit perfectly. Also, remember to halve the amount the directions tell you, they almost always go on the higher end so you buy more sooner and will kill your plants.

If y'all are interested in the original thread, now deleted, I did screen cap the starting question and would be interested to actually turn it into a philosophical debate and possibly come up with an answer. However due the the possibly heated nature of the question would request that name calling be removed entirely from the discussion. Yes people may have ideas that are very different from your own, as is there perspective. Change a perspective and you may just change the way the issue is seen. This cannot be done if you are just calling the person stupid, say it out loud, scream it at your computer, but keep your replies separate and you may yet cause the perspective shift. Let me know if interested and I'll post the screen cap (edited to remove any and all names)
Some silly feminist post that's men replies all had a "who cares what her numbers from the past are, I prefer ____." Clearly we are all coming out and "slut shaming" for agreeing with her that the numbers don't matter at the end of the day. Some wanted more experience with their relationship, others less. The end result was a feminist calling us "slut shaming, egotistical men," deleting comments that had a relevance to the post, and name calling. Lol. I think the biggest problem is she views us as combatants when we were agreeing, entirely based on our gender identity. Now that seems like a solid plan coming from someone espousing a desire for gender equality, do the exact same thing you are complaining about being done to you, to make everything right. That's like fucking for virginity, not gonna get you anywhere.

Also, same slaughtering style as kosher meats for the Orthodox Jews.
Again, it's just a method of slaughtering the animal that is more humane, that isn't a big deal at all. A lot of people over here would support that over what we use, in a heartbeat.
Sounds badass, wish I was round town.
That just means the method of killing the animal is swift and the blood is drained. What you are buying is a more merciful death for the food you are eating, unlike the tortured animals here in America.

Right, but if you resize to where it's under 500kb, it will automatically fit on any screen, without the need to be resized by the person you are submitting to. That goes for my 13" laptop screen, as well as the 27" gaming monitor. Dimension size 500x685 pixels if the semantics really help that much. The whole point behind saying that is that it should be a comfortable size to fit on any screen, without the need for resizing. Kev I just thing you putting more thought into it than need be.

Thanks ladies, that means a lot.
Very simple, ~52 years of drinking every night is wrong with them. That's enough to turn anyone into an asshole. For the best, all they have done is stand in my way and tell me I'm wrong to be me. That will hinder me no longer.

5) history revisited where steam is the only source of power, possibly originating from an anime called Water Boy (I believe that's the title I saw at dcon)
As long as I don't have to buy a bunch of sp gear to do so, sure thing.

He actually let me be two nights in a row. Then again I only got 5 hours sleep last night, however like 6 after his wakeup call lol.
She isn't my mother, just the bitch that paid a friend to skip the stack of legitimate adoptive potentials and give me to them. Then spent my life saying "I wish I had a daughter." Bitch you shoulda bought a girl baby then.
I kinda wanna fuck with them. Someone should call my parents house pretending to be the fuzz saying my body was found and that I killed myself last night with a note reading "I can't take all the heartache yall have caused anymore" or some shit, lol. Of course recording the response :P Is that instigating too much?
If they had ever taken the time to get to know me, rather than judge from a distance, they would realize that I am a very kind hearted guy, smart, driven and going to do something with my life, just as soon as they stop getting in my way. That doesn't always mean I make the smartest choices, but who does?
Now that my pops is blocked on FB and they won't be hearing from me again, I bet they hire another PI to spy on me, lol. Yes, that actually happened, right before they closed my bank account and put me homeless for a winter in Boston.

You hear all about the cystine chapel, which is just a damn painting on a ceiling. This building is all hand crafted, in India and shipped over piece by piece and is clearly not the home temple.

I don't have the gas to get there, he's going to the closest one, cause I can get there and home.
nah, he doesn't hurt to get pet, he's terrified of it. Occasionally he actually seeks it, usually in a bid to get food.

Those are still good, actually. The ravioli wasn't terrible, but i remember it being SOOOOO much better. Then again, I went with a new kind.
He's gone first thing tomorrow, i'm fucking tired of putting on my fresh clothes only to find cat piss. My nice leather jacket was the last straw. One site says enzymatic cleaner or white vinegar, the rest say liquids destroy leather, throw it out.
well, new kitty, but he loves new kitty, initiates play all the time.
no, hes just an asshole
most definately
It was DEFF better as a kid :P
funny you mention that... My chef made pizza ravioli... I of course mean the lovely Chef Boyardee ;)
^^ they stopped taking in cats, they are overflowed. My parents are on the board, tried that one, already... the only reason he aint gone already is I felt bad about the shelter he has to go to. I have no more fucks to give, he's done.
He HAS to go first thing tomorrow, craigslist will take forever. He is done in this house ASAP, i do not want him pissing on any more of my clean clothes or nice things.
I think all religion needs to go. It was intended to bring us together and create a set of morals within the followers. All it has done is cause people to look up at the sky trying to find an imaginary concept, while destroying what is factually giving us life. You want to see God? Look at your feet. This is what factually gives us the air we breath, the food we eat and the water we drink. Without it, we all die, yet we are too busy fighting over fictional storybook character's proper names to see that in 20 years we will have no more polar ice caps, no more artic species, and a permanent +6 degree change to our atmosphere, probably killing off thousands more species of animals. Now is the time to drop that bullshit and band together as a species to figure out how we are going to survive ourselves. What gives us life is dying, because we are killing it. Doesn't that make us a parasite?
The only one that takes cats is a kill shelter, it's that or out the front door. Had him since he was a kitten, even with fresh litter it's the clean laundry, or nice clothes. He just totally destroyed a nice jacket, he's gone before I kill him myself.
The problem with Jesus is his followers who grossly miss the ENTIRE point of his fictional story. His last word were "and this rule supercedes all I have said before. Love one another as I love you, and you will know my followers by the love they show others." Last I checked telling someone they were going to hell for their core belief is anything BUT showing love.
Lovely

Dude gotta work on his wingman game something fierce lol
I remain a skeptic on most things. Let's face it, the US government is total shit about telling the truth. They feed misinformation to media, which goes directly to us and is believed because the idiot box told them. Plus it was ruled in Tx and they are sharp as marbles there.
Dude that is simply fantastic
And you've already save probably like $150 from it. When I quit, for a while, I just kept putting most of that into my savings account. When I unquit... It later emptied for the nicotine :(

I think that end sums it up perfectly, better to push a friend into a role they have the look for and be a part of the production by being a helping hand to what benefits the wallet. Idk if y'all have management, or not, first thing mine told me was to ONLY take extras positions for feature films. They already have all roles cast, you don't need to look to a future with them. Episodical is different, always cast changes, if you feature extra less likely you will ever get a big boy and girl check from that show. Effectively a blacklist for a real work and the real check.
Well then I must have Ed Zachary disease then.... Cause apparently my face looks Ed Zachary like my arse ;).

When David said he had like 4-5 of 40 planned zombies, I knew exactly what to do. This serves a dual purpose, it gives them more reason to be impressed by us (shooting to get us credits in this one), and I think it makes them more likely to use us in the future. Folks this is where we really need to band together and become an invaluable asset to the production. That producer has quite the resume, we want them to think of us first when they come to Atlanta. They were excited when I said I could bring in prominent twd walkers, yes other people, such as Amanda will also get invited, as I asked her to ride share to make getting to Nashville easier. We are STILL just extras, so some people know our name, but even if we are planning another life, we ALL want to make it to LA, with the big checks that come with it. As long as we are bickering over conventions over past work (yes after the hubbub about me asking a dear friend to ride share to Nashville I saw here, I mean y'all too) we just look stupid. However, Hollywood has shown us an path that has worked for many. How many groups of people do you see always in the same movies? That to me says these people were likely friends from the beginning and help each other up. Forget the cons, they are fun, good networking bits, but we CAN have more, if we play the golden ticket we have right. And yes... twitter is just this important, failing to get on a free service that reaches the entire world in seconds and learning the ins and outs of social media marketing, is shooting yourself in the foot. I am happy to help point y'all in the right direction and will include y'all in anything that I think I can pull off. We rise together, or likely fall short of our not so hidden desire to rock this awesome career.

I left out one link, as it has the premise of the film. If you are interested in seeing that part, drop me a message. I just figured that should probably be kept fairly hidden from view.

IMO the real problem is our complete disregard for our own breeding. We have too many mouths to feed on the planet, yet think we can still continue at the rate we are going. Since we have built a false, concrete jungle for ourselves, we see ourselves as removed fro the natural cycle, a problem that seems larger here in America.
Before I turn 50, we will have destroyed the environment to the point of a permanent +6 degree shift to the climate, melted all the remaining glaciers and be pretty boned. Why are we still arguing about which imaginary man in the sky is "real" and fighting over resources like nothing is going on?

Goodie, we may just learn how to get the rich assholes that destroyed this planet to the next, before everyone dies from environmental collapse.
Apologize later, if needed. Sums up American policy pretty well. I just wonder how long it is before the world is mor afraid of us than the nukes and launches an attack. We are LITERALLY no different than the nazis and have committed EVERY crime they did, yet are the "good" guys?
You can trust the government, just ask the Native Americans, living in the third world country called a "reservation" that we shucked them to as we murdered their men, women and children. Treating their kindness with small pox infected blankets. I'm sure they will give a glowing review, free insurance sure makes up for being treated worse than our Population stolen from Africa. At least we weren't just trying to exterminate them (still awful behavior, but lesser evil than genocide IMO)
The funny thing to me is both attacks that have landed o our soil came at a time when our military was doing a "training exercise" that prevented the attack from being stopped. Now how do people hiding out in caves in the desert, living in a third world country know our military's training schedule? I do not believe in coincidence, I fully believe that G.W Bush was behind 9/11 and that the seal carrying the black bag exactly matching the bomb in Boston, planted it. The kids backpacks were grey or white. Now we have dead children, our military had their martial law training exercise and we "lost" three lives. However the dude without the legs, got wheeled out of the wreckage TWICE, once with a leg prosthetic falling off. The military hires actors for training purposes (proven fact). My Ed's parents work for the NSA, they knew 3 days prior their contract was going to extend for at least a year more (retiring after this one) how would they know that prior, if our government didn't know the bomb was going off. Only war can involuntarily extend a military contract.
If we really look at it, the "terrorist" organizations make their money off what out country deems illegal. So by legalizing and regulation quality, mandating safe use areas, etc. The power can literally be stripped from them as their funding is removed. In effect, we are giving out enemies money to kill our own population, and fight against a government that probably SHOULD be fought against.

Awww poor Van Diesel.
Because if the lives could have been prevented through their prior knowledge, then the blood lies on their hands. Plus I personally find it odd that a terrorist hiding from our drones in a cave in the desert would know our governments military training exercises to land two attacks in a relatively short span. The last attack happened during Clinton and is factually proven to have been a device that was supplied to the "terrorists" by the CIA.. Yes, they have admitted to it too. With the past track record and just a little detective work your mind will unlock. :)
@ Charmane Yes, caught it myself. Tad bummed I couldn't find my fly rod though.
She gets that a lot, finally getting old moments, she's a bit arthritic.
You are a god damned genius
Proven by 9/11. The two families that made the most money from that event is the Bush family and the Bin Laden family. Together hey own a majority of our weapons manufacturing plant. In any other case, beside presidential, that is a REALLY solid motive and would warrant at least a little investigation.
It was epic :).
Because the sniper wasn't the cover for our government planting explosives to raise fear levels to even higher proportions so they can remove more of the fundamental rights that once made this country great. People in Boston listening to the police scanner report hearing them say "watch your mic we're going to kill this fucker" about the small child. Of COURSE the big child fired and tossed bombs, he had military trying to kill him, I would have fired back and used everything at my disposal too. Hope those men feel proud putting so many bullets in a child the coroner stopped counting.
At the house. Sounded like a concussion, but could easily be way more serious.
Nah, at the farm. There was an accident across the st at the horse place.
Pretty sure just a bad concussion
Been working on mine, helicopter interrupt.

First of all, having been homeless in that area 10 years ago... I know there are cameras everywhere, or at least there were 10 years ago. the simple fact that they don't know who it was seems a bit far fetched.
I bet the person behind the bombing is going to be some pasty white dude.
Shameful. Thank you for being the one post I saw put up.

Oh I agree stupidity, however am getting tired of event after event leading to rights being taken from the citizens.
I always get suspicious about shit like that. That area of Boston has cameras freaking everywhere already. Or at least it did 10 years ago, I can only presume the number has vastly grown. Did it stop or prevent a damned thing? No... Has it been used to arrest any of the number of hoodlums I watched rob Harvard students, on Camera, right outside university gates? Not in my experience, they preformed the same ruse night after night. So what good WILL putting cameras and the like do. Jack and shit if you ask me. Just an excuse to stir up the populations fear so irrational laws can be forced through.
Sweet, thanks ;-D
Perfect for a summer home.

Fact, dressing provocatively (being sexy) attracts EITHER sex (ref Norman Reedus, or Mila Kunis). Fact, both men and women can both be victim OR attacker. There is no blame going to the victim for dressing how they choose, but more attention = more likelihood that one of the people looking is a sicko. Again, i am NOT saying it is the victims fault they caught the attacker's eye, however he OR she now has a bigger problem to deal with than what he/she was wearing. I have also been drugged and raped... By a woman. A sicko is a sicko, that's all there is to it, it is NEVER the victims fault. Now please both of y'all, let it rest.

To my knowledge the arteries would spout blood without tying off the arteries.
You just burn the cut part. Medically speaking with what Rick did... Hershel prolly would probably die from blood loss. It would close the wound, arteries and all, clean it (that hatchet couldn't have been sterile) etc.
I still think cauterizing would be best ASAP. stops blood flow fast, cleans ALL bacteria and creates a buffer. Keep that clean, easier business.

Merkel reiterates despite FDP resistance wage limits

14.02.2013, 10:08 clock

Demmin (AP) - Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken out again despite the opposition of the coalition partner FDP for the introduction of a minimum wage in Germany. They would "point out again and again: we need minimum wage limits" the FDP, the CDU leader said the Political Ash Wednesday her party in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The people needed much labor, that they could live on. The CDU is for the widespread introduction of regional differences, but binding wage floors for all employees who are not paid according to collective agreement.

Think about our economic situation... No matter how much money we create (the Fed isn't a government institute, mostly foreign banking interests on the board) we have to take it from the bank at a loan. So for every dollar on the market, it is implied debt.
It's a silly thing to base out society around. Stupid fat fingers hit send early :-P
Right, but for a business to make money, there must necessarily be money to spend on it. As money is an imaginary concept, that we humans created.

Much nicer than the last rattler I saw. Almost out my pack on a 6+ footer deep in a canyon in Az. Diamond backs are no joke. I got very lucky, was ~2' from fang when he told me he was mad.
What I never understood is women coming in fighting for a system that clearly doesn't like them. Lets face it, Catholicism doesn't like anyone that isn't male and hetero. Part of our bigger problem on this planet, too many mouths to feed. Many gay and lesbian folks are helping this species wide problem by voting out of reproduction, while the church (broad and sweeping, not all intended) is a large proponent of multiplying like mad. Now this was vital 2000 years ago, when we HAD to have 6 kids so one MIGHT make it to adulthood and pass their DNA on. Now we don't need that, we are out of the food chain in our self built jungle, so does the same theory apply? Hell no.

I love it... It's a totally different take of the Govey from the comix. He, in this, is starting to smell like the good guy. Rick and troop fired on unarmed civilians, while Govface was forcing a proven traitor into gladiator's combat. That's a fighting chance. I see now why Savini couldn't play the gov. He's a different person than the comic. We want to hate him, buuuuuut, we may be quick to our judgement. I now half expect to see Rick in a tank crashing through Woodburry.
^^ Awesome suggestion.
damned flat ass state... He woulda had a super bike though, let's face it.
well we know it's true.
^^^ I don't worry about it, lol. That is one of the last rights we have that makes this country fairly great, the right for Chick-fil'a to oppose gay marriage is the same right that allows our gay and lesbian brethren to demand equality. Can't have one without the other, therefore I support that right to the full extent. Yup, read that a morale justification to continue my waffle fry addiction. As an ordained minister that has only officiated over gay or lesbian marriages, I think I have earned the right to selfishly wolf them down.
But it DOES get all sorts of involvement.

Basically I can turn the actions of both the local head, and the European head of the "studio" into something that would likely convince a jury to charge them as if they were an international crime syndicate. I recieved threats to my person and house for not sticking around, putting my time, effort, and money (wihout promised reimbursement). Not only that, but now a dear friend has also been threatened because paying work ALWAYS trumps shit that is free. On top of shady contracts that the "ceo" was trying to push through with various bands, behind the back of the lady who brought them, without paying her for her time, or having any sort of stipulation of her getting paid in the contract. I'm really not sure of all the legal jargon required for international things of that nature, but it was apparently some version of illegal. So both the heads are committing clear crimes, with viable evidence against them and a close connection to each other. What court ever won't sentence them as international criminals (MUCH larger mandatory minimum). I played nice, but this shit has gone to far and I'm really done playing, as are more than a few other people, including the current label afore mentioned bands are locked too.
I dream i'm watching a fictional news channel. Oh wait... many of their reports have been proven to be factually lacking.. Shit, guess it wasn't a dream after all.

Oh it's all despicable farming practices, hormones, genetic engeneering, etc. I'm betting those horses lived a better life than any other animal served for food, in America, if not the world. They at least have a use other than food, after, they become glue, gelatin and apparently BK burgers.

^^ well stated. I think that the image does have a slight bit of truth to it, although failed logic. Lets face it, around spring time we know there will be a vicious ad campaign, targeted at women, for weight loss. Most of them commenting on "get your bikini body ready for summer." With so many women already facing self-esteem issuess (seriously yall, you look great be confident in who you are and don't let the current standard of "beauty" clout your self image) I would imagine that wouldn't help boost confidence to be in undies OR a bikini.
Unless you can get me in the door, I am not.
Yeah yeah... Have a blast dude. Don't forget to take a bite out of your guest so you absorb his power.
Who doesn't love the taste of white gas, 151, or golden grain. MMMMM fireballs.
Sadly Paige, yall now got that one. Women are allowed on the front lines, which means that your feminist sisters first earned you the right to be drafted, should our Gov ever want to try that fiasco again. More to the point, a draft including women has already been posed, prior to the front line addendum. I have walked around naked on many a camping trip. In fact, I spent about 1/2 of my college orientation with nothing more than a shirt tied around my waist. I have never been afraid of my body and I still don't see a valid reason why extra fat glands is such a scary thing.
IDK, frankly, I think everyone has seen the shit anyways with google being what it is... a gateway to wanksville, a teenaged boy's paradise. The precedent of fearing our bodies is stupid. We come in the the world naked and unless you are a celibate monk will likely see at least a few naked people in your life. Ironically laws that make sex taboo only increase the rate of sexual assaults. If you look at countries that have legal brothels, the statistics of rape and other sex crimes are vastly diminished. Our aversion to the human body drives our society to commit more of these crimes.
happy bday lady.

Jennifer, pavlov is always painful ;-).
Aye, you and me both. Sadly I am a felon for what I was not committing and got away with everything else I was doing as they had 0 evidence. Point of the story being, I should have walked free, upon US law, however the justice system is naught but a business. For my time in the clink, the us government got $112,500 and I was only in for 4 months. In what world does that shit box, with terrible food cost $112,500 for just 4 months of living expenses. For the same price, I could have been sent to a nice rehab facility, complete with pool, jacuuzi, spa, complementary massages with possible happy ending and movie stars as roomies. I lived in a roach infested shit box, with murders and rapists (that was a constant war, literally saw the shit beaten out of a dude, no joke) and ate the shittiest food on the planet. I seriously cooked better meals out of the trash can, or a mop bucket, which was my preferred source of food. The best part is, I blew a 0.00 for the DUI i got. Or 9/11, with the most minimal of research you find that the two families that stood the most to gain by the country entering war is the Bin Laden family and the Bush family, together they own a majority of the company that makes our countries weapons. WAIT!!!!!! We are giving the family that attacked us billions of $$ a year??? Hrmmmmm
In this day and age, one must doubt all sources of information. For example the anti-smoking people have been proven to have paid scientists to find out that second hand smoke is damaging. Since their articles got published in Dr Journals, thousands read them, then didn't do the follow up research to find that those same scientists have come out admitting that they got paid. So because of one original lie, millions of people believe an invalid truth because they couldn't do just a little homework. You are right to question everything, that means that your mind is sharp, die before you let that go.
Bingo. Tis why I chose to minor in it. On a resume it says I know how to think. I can't see that as being a bad thing.

yeah, but you are paying a "convenience" fee, plus for the end letter to be official on a transcript. Frankly, I wish I had done that for my core classes, although then I would have the problem of just not wanting to do the stupid work. What good will an American Government class, that I was able to give current event reasons as to why what he was telling us was bullshit. Basically, it's a class on how the government is SUPPOSED to work, not the reality.
In mine we had to do online replies to reading assignments, then reply to two of our classmates posts. One of the girls in my class, wrote without punctuation, capitalization and in Ebonics, not actual English.

Right, but as people mistake the difference, it needed to be clarified. Remember men can't read the subtle nuances of what women mean, vs what they say they mean.

Idk if you have actually looked into the Muslim religion, but it is quite beautiful. Many of their followers are 100% peaceful and actually practice the "turn the other cheek" bit that followers of Christ process to follow. As a liberal, I thought that fit to weigh in and explain my reasoning for not judging Muslims, as a whole. Or perhaps point in the direction of the company that is producing our weapons, owned in majority by the Bush and Bin Laden family. Wait... You mean the two families that created the war... Stand the most to gain???? Hrmmm, I may not be good at math, but any cop in the world would find that a bit suspicious. Plus what is rule one for detective work? Talk to the family, friends, etc. Yet they flown out on Air Force One before they could be questioned?? If you want science, I can go into scientific reasons why the entire official story necessarily MUST be false. As for gun control, I vote against those sissies and anytime fundamental rights are being taken away that once made our country great. Lets face it, if the teachers in those schools had been packing, the gym teacher woulda put down the threat after one shot. Crazies exist everywhere, from the top down. After the Patriot Act, based off an attack the facts point to being an inside job, I have learned to be weary of huge public scares, right as very damaging legislation is passed. You can trust the government, just ask any Native American.

Hopefully the American population will wake up and realize that the only reason we didn't get invaded, by our own allies, for starting a war that violated NATO sanctions, is because we have the nukes. That is the one thing the world has to respect the USA for, well that and our proven willingness to use them. Fear can only hold enemies at bay for so long before they team together and take out whatever it is that is threatening to them.
Ahh, see I vote that while we are a part of society, we are not society.

I got involved with someone who wasn't who they said they were. I am heartbroken that it turned out to be bs and y'all laugh at me for getting "suckered." Hardly what I would call support, or even helpful. In fact, the morning spent there was not only hurtful to myself, but to the woman I love who heard the comment that was my last straw, directed at myself and Allison. Funny, for a woman that pretends to have studied psychology, she sure lacks a lot of understanding of it. When someone is hurting, laughing at their misfortune and telling them how much they messed up does not win the likelihood of a further visit. Yes, I am taking the semester off, It is too late to change that, so I can either move forward in a productive manner, which I am shooting for, or I can let it cripple me.

And by past mistake, you are not aware that he spent three days in my house sucking down beer and refusing to leave. During this time he was rude to those around me, made lady friends VERY uncomfortable and didn't pay for a damned thing. Plus I noticed that there was far less of my cash stockpile than there should have been. Knowing he went to rehab for both alcohol and crack, and knowing how falling off the bandwagon for one means that the other isn't far behind, if not already off... We can assume that he is still smoking rock too. aka nothing past about the mistakes.

Yeah, was there much of the morning, it is far less helpful than the Az version. Being quite familiar with the laws there, which really do more to protect tenants than here, I expected something similar. Sadly, Georgia seems to favor the landlord.

Funny you mention that, first time I watched that movie I was 11-12 and leaving on a camping trip the next day. The following morning, I was told that the lake I was camping at, was what became of the river they filmed at, after it got dammed. I was scared as hell the entire trip, lol.
It was glorious, until we reached the outskirts of Dallas, where it started to piss down snow. This + a big gust of wind = spin out, into the grass median. It was a hell of a journey. Sadly, weather meant I drove the entire way, but we made it safe and sound, without a scratch to any person, or vehicle. :-D
Easiest path is straight through. Spent the night in old Mississippi last night, due to weather. Glad that is behind me now.
No they weren't reading in traffic, they were reading while going through a construction zone with cement medians.
Wish I could make it, sounds like a blast.
Nice man, good for you.
This makes four times in the past week, And twice in the past 24 hour.

I have a 3 min bus ride to bars. But plan to be at the cheapest bar ever... My couch.
Once in my entire life, and only because it was ironically the least likely option to jail. Sneaking 3 dogs into a hotel and going out to dinner = 3 dogs barking and getting kicked out of said hotel with minutes before the manager calls the police. Since there was a bar next to the restaurant (which we suspected we needed cause it was a health code nightmare in there) we drink many shots of 151. Namely cause we thought it would kill any bacteria that was swarming the food we ate. I drove 1/4 a mile to the next hotel. They didn't kick us out ;-).
Now don't be like that, it's not like you didn't breast feed till 14. Talk about uncomfortable coming over to dinner.
I never do :-D. I drink and stumble, way more likely to lead to a wild and crazy adventure. :-D

They hit close to home but missed an important part. Centralized banking is a corrupt system that necessarily means that there is debt on every dollar in circulation, as the Fed is a private bank, nothing federal about it.

Remember the last school shooting in Oakland California where the police were too busy reading a legal medical cannabis facility to even respond.
Dude here's my thought on it if the teachers in that school had been carrying guns it would've gone much differently. He would've gotten one shot off and the gym teacher would've put him the fuck down. Frankly while I am not for violent crime I'm even more against guns being taken away from the population. Especially since our police force is designed to do one thing and take down nonviolent offenders. If you look at the statistics in 2009 7% of all incarcerated people in the United States were in for violent crimes, So why are the other 93% behind bars? Frankly, I think it's because the police don't actually catch violent criminals and if they weren't busting people for having a joint in their pocket they wouldn't have any crime statistics. If this came through unclear in any way I used speech to text while driving And Siri is almost retarded.

The funny thing he was asking if she believed in kissing under mistletoe, I have been given WAY worse lines in a game called whoever gets slapped gets to drop their tab on the group to split, and still payed at the end of the night.
I love that he straight up gets slapped, hahaha.
Just got a text, every one is fine.
Just emailed her fiance, we'll see. *fingers crossed*
I know she said she works about 30 from where she lives, and the town the shooting was in is 30 from her town... Not many other towns around so safe to presume she is close to the area, and was this morning :-/.
Yall been by me through thick and thin, I assure you nothing will be forgotten :-D.
Praying to the porcelain gods is always a great way to start the day. Wait a minute.... morning what?
Pass some over this way grandma
It was 10 years ago last Thanksgiving. Today marks when I headed back up, via Brooklyn.
In the past month and a half, I have been hit TWICE, about 500' from both sites. You aren't kidding people cannot drive.
RIght back at you.
but that is also assuming someone else doesn't chime in and fuck you up :P

You are the damned Bruce Lee of nastiness man. "I'm sick and can't move around much... Time to focus on what I want to be doing..." Love it man, keep up the blood curdling thought process.
but really, lets face it... Is that twitter account likely managed mostly by the celeb, or his/her PR manager?
sadly that negates the control aspect of an experiment and I could create an account and reply, "OH yeah dude, I remember now!! How the hell are you??"
lol
entirely possibly that a celeb isn't as stoked to meet us as we are to meet them, which makes us not a highlight, just a feature of work. (Damn philosophy classes have me playing devils advocate on everything)
Depending on the level of interaction though, how many of the people that you interact with on a daily basis do you remember the interaction entirely for every one?
I think it may invole a little ATM

but of course my friend. Tis just the inflamatory name I chose off a fb joke turned into 18 hour hotdebate and 6 hour attack on my character etc, while at work, from two stalker chicks I went to HS with. They must be mad I never tossed them a bone, but there's too much crazy for one man to sleep with.

I prefer my human flesh aged to perfection. I demand that my trailer have an unlimited supply of all the 50+ year old snack food I could want. I also require TONS of febreeze and vitamin water, I MAY be a zombie, but that doesn't mean I like to smell myself rotting. As for the vitamin water, it must be cooled with ice from an Alaskan Glacier, and have human blood mixed in a 50% vitamin water, 70% human blood concentration. Failure to do so will result in my no longer participating in said event. *grumpy face*

That is a fine line for an apocalypse. Totally cool to kill people, but damn if you can touch someone under 18, but what better way to settle down after murder, plus you should have plenty of blood left all over you for lubricant.

Yeah, totally I shoulda laid off the bath salts before stepping onto set and it MIGHT have been a good idea to do something about the T-virus running rampant through my veins. At least it was only one old man who got hurt during filming, it could have gone MUCH worse.
yeah, that might be a good idea for me too... So glad the worst of finals is past, only one left and i get to take an outline for my essays into class. Only thing I could do to fail is be retarded and not be able to intellectually state an opinion.
Awwww,too cute.
The real question is, why the hell am I awake, I didn't end up sleeping till like 4am, I just gave myself a FB ban last night. Clearly I used my powers for evil, yesterday without lifting much of a finger.
Without stupid stalkers I fear that I am just a regular guy today. Albeit a regular guy with a total knack for finding trouble... giggity.
Sadly an attack that 100% could have been prevented as Japan won't attack without declaring war. Not to mention the plans for the attack were in the president's office, yet nothing got done. The real crime there is the governments' refusal to protect the brave men and women destined to be attacked, as a method of generating enough citizen angst to propel this country into the war. Let's remember their sacrifice, by not allowing these sort of injustices to prevail in our country ever again.
I heard maybe, I'm betting it's a family guy weekend haha.
Well my two stalkers have both been reported to FB for harassment and hopefully, banned from use, haha. Sadly, this means that my posts will now get boring until I acquire more stupid stalkers that want to attempt public humiliation. Until then, I am not responsible for the lack of amusement that could have been generated if I had dumber friends. Pat yourselves on the back folks, you could be that dumb, and crazy.
You got it brother, I couldn't have done it without help from awesome friends like Kevin Galbraith and new friends such as yourself, Tim Proctor. Yall rock. Now to get some prints made :-D.
I'm right there with you, my dear. Waiting with baited to breath to see if my all or nothing gambit with my Japanese final will win me my pass, or if i fail on a stupid technicality. Either way fuck a beginner class that gives you too little time to complete the assignments, on the 90% timed homework assignments. Or the tests that contained material from the second level of the course. Good thing I was taking that class for the hell of it, I'd be REALLY pissed if it had to have it to graduate.

haha, finally caught up... Thank you all for trying to talk sense into two VERY moronic women. Seriously, yall are the only creatures in the fucking world that are STILL right, even when there is no way in hell that you can deny to yourself that you are clearly in the wrong.
Your absurdity rivals that of the gummy bear semen jesus. That dude was nuts.
i offered to whack some one for you, I'm sure that's on a special watch list or 10, lol.
I'm sure she will enjoy the long cleanup :p
and Heather, well I spammed the fuck outta HER page, about the atrocities she commited today.
Nah, I sent Kelly the public bit and deleted her with a fond fuck you.
Missa D Dilbeck, apparently I'm 200% in the club, lol. Holy jeebus this shit was brutal. Wow!!
I spammed her profile with the hate she spread AND her public expose of private matters.
Well, since she wouldn't step forward, I took matters into my own hands...
yup, that is called instigating, you want to instigate, lets go
I agree Kitty, I pity these sorry girls. I understand that this is their displeasure with their own life choices spilling out on me. Frankly, I've just been waiting to fully weigh in, when I could sit down and type it all out. I don't have a problem airing issues out, although would have vastly preferred a private forum, but the time for that shit is past and my FB is one miserable bitch lighter. Still waiting on Heather Lynn Kinikin to not be a pussy and come out when I am actually here to defend myself. Like a true coward, she is still hiding. Come on vapid romurmonger, bring it cunt.
AHAHAHAHAHA "maybe your my hater and jealous of me" LMFAO. HAHAHAHAHAHA. After literally admitting that she has 3 dead beat daddies, prior. Seriously? Man, what did I do to get all the hate and anger she feels towards the poor men that were dumb enough to have gotten with her in the first place. Don't be a bitch, the next one might not leave you, just a thought.
And now Heather Lynn Kinikin is too chicken to step forward
Right?
I'm still like 2 hours ago, lol, Dawg, Dawg, Dawg, lol
yeah, wading through it now and you's deff be right Missa. I really couldn't read shit all night. I thought I was replying to posts that were hours old all night.
HHAHAHA, Alex this shit is gold man. "as the hippie who's mom got creampied by god would say" hahahahahahahahahaha
jeeze, shit got outta hand while I was at work, I have yet to find where I left off and was unable to read. The number of posts surpassed what my I5 could keep organized hours ago. It became read through it all and find the new comment, or just laugh that this shit was still going on.
And I am now on like 10 FBI lists lol
Save love for the haters, they only make you look better because clearly people think about you too much, or are jealous. In a sick and twisted way, it's a compliment. Sorry to hear you got some shit, need me to wack a foo?
yeah, she clearly saw Heather Lynn Kinikin digging her own grave and tried a different approach to save face. However, a different approach doesn't cure stupid and I don't need her help, I got my situation covered.
Right, I must have done SOMETHING right to get that much thought from two girls.
Still, this has GOT to be a record for a VERY active debate. I will remind everyone that this post started Monday.
Alex, I fucking love you brother. You got me tearing up over here you rat bastard.
The one that got away, haha. I don't tend to fall for the douche bag approach.
FUCK YES WE SHOULD!!!!!
Yeah, I finally was able to give them the public airing out they so desperately called for before assaulting my profile with hate, while I couldn't even read the damned posts. Shit got super serious up in this bitch.
oh shit, it just got serious... Looks like you are, both, in fact fools... STILL!
Hell I was Mr mom, till she was gone. Breakfast lunch and, after quitting Starbucks, dinner too. She waited up for me every night of her life, couldn't go to bed without a hug and kiss from dada. You better believe the lack of her in my life is a HUGE point of contention in my life. Upon advice from my attorney, I wait, get through college and have something that can counterbalance a grave mistake that haunts me from the past. As mommy refuses anything from me, unless Rhian is sick and needs medical care and stepping into the court before I have something of substance to counterbalance would be a fatal mistake that would likely lead to the same situation I have now. As long as we are airing out private matters in a public setting. Got a problem with how I am handling the shit situation that I have been given, take it up with me in private or GO FUCK YOURSELF WITH A RABID PORCUPINE. I will hear no more of this shit, you have earned yourself a special place in Hell for being a self rightious douche bag. Be glad that I laughed at your stupidity all day. You took it way too far, while I was entirely unable to defend myself, thank you to all my friends that stepped in.
sounds like alex alright
Heather and Kelly didn't like being the bad end of the joke, the side that was too stupid to understand. So thus they choose to bring a bunch of hate to my FB after initially being angry about perceived "disrespect and rudeness" resulting in them turning and being incredibly hateful about a situation they no nothing about.
and has been a laugh the entire night. Yall fucking rock my box, best way to unwind after either acing my Japanese test and passing, or D failing because of a stupid technicality.
Still, most epic post EVER.
Only because I haven't been able to rid my facebook of the other holier than thou bitch on my fb.
one tard down, next up, Heather Lynn Kinikin. Here vapid rumormongor, come on, eat my shit.
Allison Przylepa apparently you are now a 12 year old boy, how very Michal Jackson of me. Wait... he's old news... Let's use Jerry Sandusky with this one, go Penn State ;-).
"Sorry you took it out of the intended context, I just figure while others encourage acts that bring nothing positive to him I will be the one to stand up and offer some advice that will!" Try coming to me when you are paid to give your autograph. (yeah, I just went there, I am home and the gloves are off). If you are unhappy about the, what, 2 baby daddies you have, realize that I am not either of them, you know nothing about the situation you are professing to be an authority of, and that all day myself and everyone else involved in this post has been laughing at your stupidity. D'o your self a favor and shut the fuck up. You started this post in a tirade against me being disrespectful, then when you realized that you were outgunned and ill prepared for ANY sort of intellectual debate, you resulted to childish lengths, creating rumors and falsehoods on my page, further making you look stupid. After 4 requests to stop the hate, it continues, proving that you care nothing for "respect" you demanded earlier and now leaving you looking like you belong on the short bus. Do yourself a favor and drink the shit under your sink, you are wasting perfectly good oxygen. Now to do myself a favor and cut the tards from face book, but not after allowing them to jump in and prove they saw this message.
Thank dude, you rock. I'm feeling the need for some farm time over break. Kidnap Heather Sparks for me ;-).
Damn it feels good to be a gangster.
I do too, lol. Steal me one haha
Dude just let them have their hate. I can only imagine how horrible it must be, day in and day out, to be these sad souls filled with so much nastiness and hate. Plus we should thank them, really. Without the insipid comments, this post would have been boring on Monday.
Damn, this shit is STILL going lol. I can't wait till I can get home and see the respect and consideration my ignorant haters have left me. Unlike most people, I love haters. Don't get haters unless someone is jealous of you.
It's only kinky the first time.
Perhaps the cat just likes a good old fashioned bukakke, ever think about that?
Hopefully you mean that in the aced it type of way, not the I may retake the damn class way ;-)
Hahaha, man this has gotten nasty. Again, ironically from the two people that were against my joke out of respect. They aren't worth the time to reply, let them continue to be the punch line of the joke... Without participation, they just want the attention.
Yeah me and trying to talk sense to people who's mind function like broken parachutes, they just won't open.
Jar jar dies for his sins lol
Again, I reiterate. I appreciate your concern over issues that are none of your business, but state that it is still none of your business and you are fully exhibiting all the rude inconsiderate behavior you were so against.
That is true, plus I might actually PAY to see jar jar get beaten like Jim *sneeze sound*.
Yup, they are harmless zombies that only eat Graiiiins.
Yes, you got me I am terrified of someone making stuff up as a last ditch effort to appear like they have any relevant thoughts to put in.
I guess you were unable to comprehend that you know nothing of the situation, I have legal advice and your nose has no place sticking into it. That being said again, I am no longer going to involve myself in a battle of wits with a clearly unarmed person.
Idk a Jar jar movie modeled after The Passion snuff film would be pretty damned enticing.
Yes he sure did. Thank you Disney for removing his control over the series and please, for all us old fans, kill Jarjar in a horribly graphic and painful manor.
Yup, this post has gotten too long for my phone to keep the message times straight. I will be unable to continue this until tonight. Have fun Facebook.
Awwww darn, there I go kicking hornets again AJ Wolff...
Again, heather, without a complete understanding of the situation, you are giving 0 help here. I have spent plenty of money in legal advice and am following, to the T, the advice I have been given. Again, thank you for your concern for a situation you aren't privy to, or even a part of. However, being as you know jack and shit about it, it might be wise to keep your nose where it belongs, that goes for you too, Kelly. Y'all came with a message of anti-hate, yet have done nothing but be rude, offensive and nosey, all the while loudly proclaiming injustices over a joke. The funny thing about jokes is that they are designed to piss at least someone off. The largest part of the humor from said joke is laughing at the people who have so little sense of humor they cry out in indignation over imaginary wrongs, all the while spouting hate as an argument. Bottom line is, this post would have been dull without y'all, thank you for being the punch line on my joke :-).
Actually, while the court may say that she has to, they don't actually enforce the rule. Ga, not being an extradition state (they pull you from where ever you are found in the country) the court will do jack and shit for me. I have friends in the same boat. Again, knowledge makes your argument stronger, neither of you have a knowledge of the situation, so your judgement and hate are misguided and based off a position of ignorance.
Great idea in reply to that, Kelly. Pick a better other partner in parenthood, one that doesn't kidnap my child and then refuse to acknowledge that not only is the father dying to be there, but he is also texting weekly to have more contact etc. I can only control my actions, if she doesn't want me to be a part of my child's life, there isn't much I can do across state lines. I appreciate your deep concern for issues that do not relate to you, in the least, but before you step in acting a moral authority, get the full story first.
Heather, as she said, she didn't say much, I will assume that is because she was being at least a decent employee all day. You, however, have said quite a bit, first angry with indignation over the entire idea, preaching that it was rude and offensive (both of which are applicable to calling someone stupid, removing the power behind your argument). At this point, it seems you are just arguing to settle some childish need for vendetta over a perceived wrong, let it go.
Haha, looks like a big resounding no.
I have read the entire post and laughed the entire time. I'm not saying I disagree with what you said, just simply said that the way you said it made her approach look stronger and you like you were fighting out of your league, due to name calling. Accept criticism, realize that I am helping you for future debates and remove the foot from your mouth. Your continuation into silly name calling further degrades your anti-hate argument, as now you and Kelly, the proponents of anti-hate, have been the only two to result to name calling (hate). Therefore, regardless of prior points, you have single handedly destroyed your own argument.
Pig
Heather, the stooping to calling her stupid, while she just calmly replies being "happy you feel validated," makes everything you said prior have less power because you resorted to mindless name calling instead of a comment of intellectual quality. He who throws the first stone, looks wrong, no matter what. Despite the validity or thought from prior comments. It's why in debate there is a technique to destroy your opponent, but first you must calmly rile them to anger. Once the calls of "your stupid" come in, it is clear to everyone else that the battle of wits currently underway is a battle with an unarmed person. That is why character defamation is a widely unused debate characteristic, and yes under debating circumstances any time you result to mindless name calling, that is exactly what it will be called.
Awwww, big words killed it right in time for ME to go to work, le sigh. Probably for the best. Hard to instigate on FB while driving delivery.
Heather... Let me suggest that your argument would look stronger without the use of character defamation, which itself is part of "debating at the level of an elementary school student," as you so tactfully put it. Considering that your argumentative skills exhibited in the accusatory comment are of equal or lesser value than what you are accusing of, you just look like someone that doesn't know what they are talking about and since they have a complete lack of thought, have resulted in pointless name calling. Please try back again when your debating skills have grown and you can form an opinion, and even make replies back, without resulting to character defamation.
Well we are a sword swallower and contortionist away from a gypsy circus.
Holy shit, best cover ever lol.

Seriously, I have watched this shit like 4 times in a row. Hahahaha
and thus was the whole point of the original post, but damn did it turn out a hell of a lot better than I thought it would. Bringing people together by pissing people off, go me :-D.
Alex that is the best, and most awful post on here. I approve of that message.
@ Sam btw, I already got at the church of LDS for knocking on my door. I was sleeping naked, and just picked up a towel and wrapped it loosely. When I opened the door up, I took a wide stance and told them to come on in, as my towel was falling off.

I saw another group coming down the block like 3 weeks later. They stopped, looked at their clip board, at the house, back to the clipboard, then horrified expression at the house and onto the next.
maybe :-)
Alex, shhh I have a reputation to uphold, now tremble before the might of our dark lord, Satan.
Sam, that is glorious, I freaking love it.
Well no wonder, you got the all butt hurt and they bailed. Shame on you.
I never said anything about interrupting a service, I scream in pain at the door prior to the service I don't have any desire to actually sit through part of a service just to get my kicks, I'm way too impatient.
Woah now, did you at least take them to dinner before anal? That is the legitimate etiquette right?

When the people being disrespected attack you daily on campus, spreading hate and attempting to get struck so they can sue and make money for the church... FUCK YES!!!!!
Btw, I love y'all. This post started Monday and is STILL in hot debate. Proof that inflammatory remarks with rude and offensive undertones really DOES bring people together. More so, it brings people together with various opinions. Note to self... Make offensive FB posts more often :-).
As a Pastafarian and member in good standing of the must be funny church, anyone that cannot laugh at themselves and make light of a silly situation lives a life full of stress and misery, we should pity such a person and let them live in their burning need to be right.

Btw, the quote above is exactly what the officer at the station said to me, on the phone.
The valid reasons are why they can get away with it. Example...
"Sometimes, when its clear, the officer may not flip his lights on if its clear, because its distracting" smells like some grade A, protect the station bullshit. I wonder if there is a bullshitting class required to "serve and protect."

Probation people are the WORST, they have a shitty job, that pays them shit. Everyone that comes in there is just a dirty criminal to them, regardless of what brought you there, or not. They are always "on break," or "going on break," especially when you are confused as to which color form you fill out. Yellow? Green? A lighter or darker shade of each? Then they want to take it from you, tell you it's the wrong one and it's then time to yell loudly to the co-worker to your left about what they did last night. 1/2 hour later..... you pump rounds into all of them and go back to jail cause, fuck it, it's easier ;-).

Absolutely but the two main parties in power don't want that to happen. Independent don't really hold the clout that the other to do kind of sucks.
Yeah I agree with you Sarah, sadly I do believe that to allow people to blindly vote for the greater of two evils without trying to countermand that with voting for the lesser is foolish, that is how we ended up with Bush's dumb ass and this wreck of a country, in the first place.

As is Trumps call for birth certificate, the fact is that he is a bigoted asshole that hates minorities, poor people and women. Not a very nice guy by my standards, being an idiot to boot is a huge second knock against him. He is incompetent to lead and frankly slander articles like that help politicians, over hindering them. It inspires many people to fact check things they otherwise wouldn't have heard of, it's a good thing ;-).
Found one more I like showcasing how much we can trust him...
"As president, I will create 12 million new jobs." —Mitt Romney, during the second presidential debate
Ouch, 45 minute cycle before he forgets his lie. No bueno sir.
I can keep this up all day dude, he's a chump who hates everyone but the über rich, they have $ to give him and that's what he's really about.
If those don't scare you, perhaps this one shall...
"I like being able to fire people who provide services to me."
"I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there." Really, aren't you planning on cutting that "safety net" so you and your rich asshole friends can pay less taxes?
"When you have a fire in an aircraft, there's no place to go, exactly, there's no -- and you can't find any oxygen from outside the aircraft to get in the aircraft, because the windows don't open. I don't know why they don't do that. It's a real problem." Perhaps because the lack of pressure would suck your eyes out, as you freeze to death.
"Corporations are people, my friend ... of course they are. Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to the people." Tell kaiser to go on a beer run for me.

If you just stay horizontal you aren't adventurous enough. You should try shit that requires a stretching regime beforehand.... Totally rocks your world, till you throw your back out ;-).
Ain't, stupid auto fix.
Air that the truth.
See you seem extra smart and interesting here, I just can't figure out why...
Hey baby, how YOU doin? Girl you gotta give me them digits. I'll hug you LONG time
Ahhhhh floppies, now I feel old for having once held those dinosaur eggs in my hand.
I'm not far behind you, just a little over a year left.
We're already rolling Jamie,
Mad at me and punishes Rhian. Not saying I don't deserve her anger, just that the revenge is misplaced. Yes, it's a brilliant idea to take your daughter to a part of the country where all the women you grew up with have 5 baby daddies, work at k-mart, Walmart, or target, if they are lucky and where 2/3 siblings have seen someone shot in front of them.
Aye, baby squirrels that were in a fallen tree. They got nursed to health and released to the wild
No, I do not. A lawyer would do little good. Just cause the court orders it, doesn't mean they will enforce it. I know several fathers who have taken baby momma to court for not following visitation, no charges get filed, just "you know you have to, bye."
Right? He's literally been on all but two sets I've worked on. I swear he's the real life dude from multiplicity.
Sadly no, pictures sent from the north :-(.
The laundry part doesn't sound so much fun, but the rest sounds great. Get ya some.
That's the sad likelihood. She has over 48 hours in, ample time to loose the paperwork. My lawyer informed me that if you DO get arrested, stay in 48 hours before bail as they will have likely lost the papers by then. Sadly, he told me after I bailed lol.
At school, GSU wifi blows. Didn't see other comments till after I posted lol
Vamp diaries?
Wait... The Fox News Online Flag comes with boobs???? I want one
What you don't know if I have built up an immunity to their mind control prowess. I have reached a level of training that while lovely to motorboat, I can think when in the presence of chesticles.
Ha, you have no more power over me. Your mind control devices have been rendered obsolete.
Nuh uhhhhh!!! You just think you do, but I snuck the wifi outta that corner already. :-p
Whoa now Jonathan, you went to far man.
Huh, does Katt seem less cool and intelligent to any one else?? ;-)
I think you need to show off more of your large intelligence ;-).
Giggidy
Does ANYONE know where the hell Mr Burns is?
Awesome, glad that someone was able to clear that up, I shall delete the screenshot then. Leave it to the law dogs to fuck up and put someone in the clink who wasn't dong wrong. I'm sure that's the first time an innocent person has gone to jail.
:-D
Aye, if she was planning on coming down, Fri, then that may be on hiatus.
Why don't you come a little closer and say that. I won't bite..... I promise.... *crosses fingers*
And have a screenshot for evidence of abuse of rights, should she need it ;-)
Called in under a minute after the post and phone was off, I'm going to do some research and see if I can get to the bottom of this one.
I encourage their abuse of Heather's rights. Especially ones so blatant as a Facebook post, her lawyer will be able to use it to her advantage.
And isn't it illegal for law enforcement to have hacked someone's facebook to post that they have been detained?
Say what?
I feel asleep to it, and currently hear it, due to Kai Robbins being on the War Z Alpha.
Lol, nice :-P
War Z alpha?
Aye, that was me :-D

Gotta respect the stairway to heaven ;-).
I need to pull these down and repost the edited (lighter) versions
Like molasses covered pantyhose.
I think you got your math off dude, the other bit is 60% again.
Good for you my dear.
Shit man, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you learned how to do the philo stone in your alchemy classes yet?
Sadly, our country is founded on this sort of hate of the "different." Thusly making this part of what patriotism is. First it was the Indians, then black men and women, now that we've largely gotten over skin color we get real personal and treat people less than for their sexual proclivities. I think we should turn the tables and start hating on rich, old, politicians. Fight to put on bills that lower their wages, remove rights for their loved ones, and say take away the right to masturbate. We all know life starts possibly before you actually have sex, making it murder to pump out some baby batter. Perhaps then they wouldn't be so quick to try to screw people over to make a buck.
Uh oh, what happened, everyone ok?
Take another picture of your shirt with the jap writing clearly visible, I wanna read it, lol.
The hidden gun woman at Ruby Ridge... RUUUUUUN!!!!!
Guilty as charged. I am the ankle biter.
Thanks homie.
Really our history is pretty shitty all around, honestly this fits right in as true patriotism. Since America was founded we picked on the "different" guy. First it was stealing the Indians land, giving them small pox and trying to create genocide. Then it was the black man ad woman's turn. God forbid evolution give you a different color skin. Now that skin color can't be a deciding factor, lets go for a different sexual proclivity and hate on them. America makes me sick with this shit. Free country, if you are old, white, rich AND republican. Otherwise fuck off.
Thanks man :-)
I am in the field while they are clearing the exterior of the prison area and up on the big fence area they congregate before Rick heads out the gate.
Awww, I tried to add that gif to my photos, just goes stilframe on me :(
Sadly, I do not know when they are going to cut my piece in, until it airs. As I don't know before hand, no one can.
No problem, if you see yourself elsewhere, lemmie know.
I sure tried real hard, we'll see if he survives or not.
Mmmmm turtle soup.
So I don't need to look for you this season? :-P
So apparently I'm impressionable with media cause when I see this shit I start thinking about ways to build a space suit with duct tape and skii gear and a balloon out of bed sheets and melted rubber. Here I go.... Hop.... Wait.... Shit... I forgot something.... Oh yeah..... The chute, meh, t-12 min to impact, eat your heart out Felix Baumgartner.
Well we hate the Navy for hating on you.
I think ALL football teams should loose for being closeted homos, especially after national coming out day. Common, we ALL know you are gay, wearing your spandex, staring at other men's asses, waiting to jump on the dude with the three balls. You aren't fooling anyone.
I TRIED... But forgot my camera, and my cell couldn't pick up shit, just too dark.
Guilty as charged
Thank you sir. Can't wait to see your shit.
Hehe, you can also say you know the dude that ate ________ ;-).
At capacity 2hours prior to episode, lol
Just got here, first table inside the door?
That's not as bad as I feared. See ya in a bit.
Awesome, we're cleaning up then I spoke heading down, parking is he'll I presume?
Awwww, that sucks.
And dish is ALWAYS a bad idea. Oh no a cloud, damnit there went my service
AMC has something where dish customers can watch TWD tonight. Google it man
Look, if I knew where to buy gator meat, I'd fry some up myself.
Well perhaps she's of the variety where she spends her man's hard earned money. Clearly she doesn't make much working at Sbux.
Well then she's just a bitch, lol.
You do realize that Starbucks pays its employees crap, tips is what makes the month somewhat doable. I'm betting they get shite tips there and she was fishing. I
Hopefully in some fry batter and into some hot oil. MMMM fried gator.
Actually, it does ;-) lol.
Freaking awesome
Wait, what?? You seem to be speaking in tongues. Perhaps you got a nasty case of the T-virus while down south.
oh, and umm... HAPPY B-DAY, WOOT WOOT.
I will be there around 7ish. Hopefully a table will be able to be wrangled.
Yeah Rob, pimp out that viewing party :P
You should be up here watching it with us, you brat :P
Are you at horror in the highlands?
Gin isn't friends with anyone, lol.
BOOOOOOOOOO!

and apparently way worse at using a condom. Put the dick down game Amber.
I think so too, jump on that man.

Let's hope that holds true for teenage years, she'll be one funny looking girl and daddy will get to KEEP his hair color :-D.
カタカナデカクコトワタノシデス
woot woot
when are you coming?
and no, i didn't forget to make that $100k/year.
The problem is, for every non-violent, pot smoker behind bars, the government gets $450k/year to "house" them. Ironically, having been in the clink, you wouldn't know that you are worth more than 100$ a year.
Time to go.... Wait a min, what was I supposed to do today? Ummmm, uhhhh, well lemmie just relight this and maybe, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
Yall should come down to diesel fillin station in midtown for the viewing party. Would be cool to see yall.
Sure does Matty.
I think it's kinda funny and more than a little silly, but whatever. Gots me an awesome job that pays well with a super cool manager, no skin off my back :-D. Plus, my extra time gave me the opportunity to have openings for acting, etc.
Lady wanted a smoothie, tried to get her one and Chris was a douche, that totally settled my choice to stand firm with that one.
I won't give them any business, so your secret is safe with me.
I meant working out, my b.
Not working at smoothie king huh?
I totally would too for say a mid season finale/end season possibly.
This is prolly only one ill get to, I work Sundays.
I'm gonna shoot to be there 730ish to stake out a table.
It's on N Highland, off Ponce
Damn mommy, he's gettin big
Which apparently blows :-/. Fortunately, I qualify as insane in the membrane in a way that will probably benefit me greatly, ADHD is a good thing for once, lol.
That IS pretty awesome.
Hahaha that's awesome. The kid has it right, it's pretty badass.
Smoke lots of weed then do complicated math.
Lucky, I wanna go
Caffeine withdrawal could also be a part, depending on daily doses.
Try lots of water, it's surprising how many headaches are cured by the addition of a little h2o.
Go get those rat bastards.
Yeah, I've totally gone off on people like that at work. Gotta love jobs where you CAN tell them to fuck themselves.

Idk man, philo seems easy comparatively, show an understanding of what some likely moron said and them have an opinion of your own. Only way to be wrong is not understanding the opposition. I have to write and translate a whole different language with hieroglyphics for letters, trade ya :-P
Awe, sorry to hear bad night, you gotta come hang soon.
Holy shit, I totally wanna do this too. Damn my need for adrenaline rushes.
I'm just saying I don't consider the font of my inspiration my brain taking a "dump." Either that or he has some twisted midas touch where he shit's gold. Take your pick ;-)
Funny words from a sissy that has to write his scary dreams down or face them every night. His mental "dumps" make him loads of $, not sure I would call it a "dump" in that circumstance.
By the way, you lied, I haven't received anything from you since july.
I haven't opened that app in months lol
Depends on how much cocaine you have. If it's just that one line, you prolly save it for when you start coming down, you may need it ;-)
If you have room in your suitcase, I'm light, flexable and too broke to afford a plane ticket. :-D

Toss the wine from the glass in dudes face and just run through the rice paper partition and hope that wine in the eyes hurts for a really long time.
RIght off the highway at n Druid hills.
Lots of them, I've pointed out my license before, lead foot n all.
Busy as hell with school and loving the new apartment.
LOL, that escalated quickly.
Ohhhhh, you such a bad girl.
Too much fun
Park at Briarcliff, where I just moves is 700-730/month (depending on the renovation status) plus $46 for water, sewer, etc and $9 for trash. Bus straight to downtown right out the front door, or a 3 mile hike to Lindbergh for the train.
damned skippy.
smoking on a whole lot of jealousy
I dig this a lot.
pineapple express?
Cause its a little more difficult to tag people on the iPad and I got lazy.
That was one poop inside that was really hard to be mad at, lol.
I'm right off N Druid Hills at 85
Thanks for sharing that, been learning more about astrology lately, always nice to hear something new.
The douche bling makes it.
I think many of us that have enjoyed the company of Lori are people that have had a lot of issues with society not agree with our "politics." I know that through my tenure at NWA I really learned how to deal with the world in a way that it agrees with, while still maintaining my individuality and differences of opinion. Yes, I also learned more artful ways to bend the rules to make my reality more to my liking. Through this, I feel better equipped to take on stupid people with stupid policies and to help "relate" on a level that has a shift in their consciousness towards the other end. One day we will effect a major change, sadly today probably isn't that day and if we don't wake up soon, we may miss it entirely. I just hope that enough people get it and stand up to say enough. Politics is necessarily corrupt, it always ends up happening when one class has power over another. They are all self interested puppets, dancing to the strings of their financial backers. Until we evaluate this and work out a way to ALL co-exist peacefully, responsibly and sustainably we are just working towards our own demise. But how do we grope our way blindly out of this pit that we have dug ourselves, in a me 150-200 years.
Always a hard choice between a liar and a man with the shiteus touch (think Midas). Who do I really want to be screwed by is the question I ask when thinking politically.
Looks like a fun ride.
At least you know where the credit is probably due. Leave it to stoners to create some amazing Munchie treats
Damn that is an old picture. I miss both of those wonderful kitties :(
haven't decided yet.
Sadly, what you say is true, nasty legislation gets put in pages of otherwise innocent bills, just so it can get passed, right under our noses. However, given his propensity to tend towards the denegration of women, I would pose that the probability is he knew exactly what he was voting for.
Wahoo, bout damned time yall came back.
She was actually friends of some extended family. Thank you for keeping her memory alive.
Sounds like a good day to me.
God might be silent but damn aren't his followers loud, or is that just in the bible belt?
That is pretty darned cool
You will take me climbing there.
I am totally drained, but gonna head down and pick up the day pass pretty soon.
I am so sorry Sarah, love and light heading your way.
Sadly it's too far to pickup a connection without the walk. I don't support Sbux enough to want to have to go pay them to do my homework. Especially not with awesome coffee at home.

I MAY even be present, trying to get stuff settled so I can sign the lease and get into my new apartment. Already going to be late for my Japanese study session.
That's one of the smaller problems that we will face. By 2033 we will have changed the temperature of the environment by 6 degrees, which creates a permanent shift in the environment, probably killing thousands of species. Or perhaps the rising mercury levels in the oceans, we'll have destroyed that wonderful source of nourishment before long. As is, there is a trash pile the size of Texas in the middle of the Atlantic, as I remember. 2050 is already past what could be our last hope for salvation. Gotta hate humanities greed, we're nothing more than parasites.

Ironic, isn't it? Clear fluoride out... With more fluoride, of course.. Oh yeah.. It could cause organ failure, good luck asshole
Group: [SSDP@GSU] Students for Sensible Drug Policy at Georgia State
They also don't take in account the "safe" things, such a fluoride, that are part of our daily lives (put in tap water). Check out the MSDS of flouride, it is TERRIBLE for all of our organs, 52mg/kg being accute poisoning. I wonder if they will do any research on the long term effects of those things.
Hell yeah, you'll have to tell me all about it. Wasn't there an ever there over the weekend?
I recommend baloney and some Vaseline, shape the baloney into letters apply Vaseline and apply to the car to spell out your message. When they try to remove it in the am, their paint will strip off with it, leaving your message written on their car ;-).
You may prefer if that day was laundry day for those going to con, don't want your house smelling like day 3 Sheraton (aka gaming track)
Cool man, good for you. I wanna get my WFR, just for shits and giggles :-P
You get-er-done you soon to be WFR S.O.B.
Again Katie beats me too it, she's good.
What Katie said, is it something super serious?

Got yourself some digits, huh? Good for you.
Esmee, did you turn into a teenage boy over the summer? ;-)
Me too dude.
VEGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!!
I didn't either. Best of luck to you my dear.

right, totally didn't share mine on this thread... Love, happiness, money.

I will be there with bells on. Possibly even literally depending on what I do for costume.
Yeah, I know... Evil genius ;-).
Want a bit of help? Have your father call on behalf of "his client, Aj Wolff who has been trying to resolve an issue of not being paid for work she did monday, etc." Technically he is not saying that he is a lawyer, they just tend to assume that when the keyword "client" gets dropped. Watch how fast they change their tune when they think they are talking to a lawyer ;-).
Thanks y'all, 48 hours in, no issues.
With a firm command of completing to do lists like that, I'm surprised you ever even found that list again. Well BEFORE it became dust, anyways ;-).
Woot good for you.
Aww good luck to both of you, hope ya both have 0complications.
Smoking comes with a fight, however the money I'll save will more than make up for the week of suffering. Do a bit of math, it makes me think every time I buy a pack. I have no reason to justify that spending, specially since I've downed 2 packs in a day, 3 days this week.
@ Missa you're lucky I can't smack that cig outta your mouth through the Internet. ;-)
It's gotta happen before school starts. i made that promise to myself at the end of last semester and I plan to keep it.
Damn man, coming out with some straight yoda stuff right there.
Both, lol. Summer has been a blast, but I am ready to get back to learning, especially since I signed up for Japanese this semester.
MEEEEEE 2!!!!
If I am not mistaken those are a variety of edibles. I would have to cross reference my book and do a spore print to verify, though.
Hellz yeah dude.
Well the laughter in the photo doesn't convey that there was danger, glad you's ok.
Big old artesian mushrooms, the bottom of those can be used to draw or write on, with a twig. The bruising will keep the message locked in. Fun for wood time treasure hunt games ;-).
Holy awesome lemur assault. How did you get so lucky?
Because the bark is peeled off of about 80% of the tree, not to mention the 3" deep it was rotten.
Lol, taking a much needed break. Been hacking at it for a couple hours now. It's rock solid, inside.
Lol, we're you the one that fell breaking through the fence?
Damnit, stupid auto fix... Golden, not gilded lol.
Nah, I'm going midevil on it. Just like the good ole days of boarding school, lol. Got my trusty axe and a maddox, I'm gilded, aside from a blister or two :-p
That sounds awesome.
Good for you. I'm glad to hear it
Good, fuck them for even trying that bullshit.

i totally could
I want to go, holy shit.
Ahhh, well it's awesome, hehe.
I'm sure she'll be fine.
Holy crap, what is it with you and getting dogs like mine. That looks just like Ollie. How's Ms Jojo doin?
Hopefully it won't be long till I can join ya out there.
That she is my friend.
Hahaha, freaking awesome. :-D
Not to mention that it doesn't actually say anything clear about homosexuality, that is just people's interpretation of it. Plus, unless you are Jewish and actually give a damn about the old testament, then there is nothing of that sort at all. Sorry to say Sophia, but you just know what someone told you, and they were wrong. Please don't spread your hate on my page, keep it to yourself.
Yes, but the bible is one of the biggest causes of war, and all the pain and suffereing that goes with it. Not exactly the type of book I would make many moral decisions based on.
Damn, I hope every1's ok, deff keep me posted on this one.
Holy crap, I I hope taht he gets better really soon.
Still way better than Atlanta, glad they didn't do the history thing, it woulda been UGLY.
I think it was pretty cool, but no where near as awesome as bejing
Life has been crazy dude, you wouldn't believe me if I told you. Frankly, if I hadn't lived it, I wouldn't believe me either, lol. I spose that's pretty much par de norm for me though, lol.
I hurt myself today... REAL bad.
you and me both, thankfully it's National Tequilla day. I think you need to play some catch up ;-).
HAHAHA, holy shit, best blackout drunk story I've heard in a while, I want some details when you piece this hangover story together, lol.

Awesome, you know my number, just let me know. Would be awesome to hang with ya again, never see you.
Ok, a bit out of our normal range, but If 100% necessary we can do that. Or if you have the gas to get to us, we can put you in the driveway, and take our cars. Would mean at least 1/2 the gas spent on your part.
What part of town are you in? if we end up taking two cars, there will be a bit of room, with us. Entirely possible this may happen. I can fit 2, plus my dogs, and we know several that are coming that will need a ride.
Skyler Let me know if you need a ride, I'm sure there will be plenty of people coming down that can help with such.
Have a blastola. Heading out your way the 11th. Hit me up punk.
Hey man, been ages, how's ure summer been?
that's what friends are for ;-)
blast, i was gonna say, that'll put you driving right past me :-D
sweet, you coming up the 85?
nah, property my family owns south of the city. got a pond for some fishing. Fish fry perhaps?
Not sure, but I bet it involves alcohol. Perhaps going to the farm
Sarah Hruby there is no excuse for you not to come hang with me and my lady, then. It's been too long.

I love how they describe bath salts, a legal version of meth as "synthetic pot and lsd," lol. Clearly, they did their research before writing that article and is further proof of mass media breeding ignorance
Sweet, thanks for sharing and helping to enlighten people. Just don't expect them all to listen, or care.
There are both positive and negative aspects to it. You will both probably want healthcare if you, say get cancer. Unfortunately, as it was, you would be unable to, due to the pre-existing condition. Obama is saving lives by mandating that insurance companies cannot refuse someone coverage on that account. Sadly, it comes at a price, the companies have to GET something too. That something is everyone having to sign up for health care. However, for those of us that are broke, we qualify for Obama Care. Congratulations, we won free insurance and forced insurance companies to take on cases that are severe enough to require serious medical attention.
That doesn't sound like a bad idea.
Aye, our prisons are overflowing and becoming a privatized business. If that doesn't cause fear, it should. A business out of locking people up? We've tired that before, it was called slavery.
Frankly, that's my opinion for all illegal drugs. The US Gov spends millions of $ on "fighting" their trafficing, which just puts the $ in the hands of the people they are "fighting" against. Then once you factor in how many of the people in our prisons, each of which cost over $400k/ year in tax budgets to house in prison, are non violent offenders. It's socially irresponsible to keep this cycle up imo.
Exactly.
Perhaps NOW my damned wife will think twice before leaving the kids with me.

@Caleb Nah man, I prefer Brian Brushwood, the shock effects he does are pretty bomb. I enjoy the ones that have people genuinely freaked out.
I was really bored over winter break, so I learned a new trick, or two :--P

Vid is up, already ;-) check my timeline
Hrmmm, I may have issues with the app i used to put it up onto FB. Alex Allred and AJ Wolff please let me know if it fails to load for you.
Uploading video now :-D.
mmmmmkay, give us a few min to get a video put up ;-)
Nope, in fact, I'll drop it back in and put up the video if you like :-D
That looks bomb dude, I want the recipie
If you want some more character art, my lady does portraits on her server, I'm sure she'd be happy to do one for you.

Just simply YES!!! Sign me up.
Next summer?

Cute little fuzzball.
Sweet man, have a blast.
Good for you dude. I'm jealous.

Nice, love it.

Mail me one of those for Xmas, sounds amazing :-p
I foresee a lot of eating there, too ;-).

I hit 5 years on my next b-day and damn do I miss the west.
I think it just posts it in notifications, or something.
Ahh, it's cause you have it set to a "friend's event." I got a notification, which probably came because of that setting. ;-)
Actually... I got a message that you did, was how I found the post, lol.
holy amazing day batman.
Good news.... TWD soon ;-)
Yeah, it probably would have gone MUCH faster if they had used the air compressor method of paint application. You basically just get it airbrushed on, and it tends to go super fast.
Hell yeah it would, sounds freaking amazing.
FUCK YES. Let's do hero makeup and everything, lol.
You should just come and jump with us :-D. bwahaha
As you should be, it's not every day you get to jump out of a perfectly good airplane ;-).
They must be hurting a bit, when I called them they quoted me $250. That WAS 2 years ago, however and a big FUCK YES (finances providing ;-)
Skydive Ga, right?
I hate you a little bit right now. Enjoy the sun for me :-D/
Dude, looks like you got a really nasty case of the T virus. That is some epic makeup.

Not if you lead with a swift kick to the nuts. Frankly, I consider fair fighting rules nulled when someone tries to steal from you. They already proved they want to play dirty, rupture his nuts.

Well, alas, this one has ben canceled due to Tyler Perry's studio catching on fire.
Woot, rock it out.
Wahooo, good for you. You gotta come hang sometime, it's been way too long.
Considering that at the time of my arrest I blew a 0.00 (no intoxication) I sure did. I keep a bottle of tequila in there at all times, now.
Woot, woot.
Lots of time to sleep when you're dead. Till then I may suggest that crack is supposed to keep you awake for weeks at a time.
I hope not, cause Irone's a super nice guy.
I sure did. It's really awesome to be able to start my car without having to give it a bj. It was totally crazy.

I went once, it is a knee banging good time. I must also admit that I got horribly turned around at one point, good times.
The puppy.
Yeah, I had the iPhone version of it, but it seems I didn't get it all set up. Have it narrowed down to a general area, but can't find it from there. I think the dog may have been chewing on it, I remember turning the sound on earlier. Hope it's not just plain jacked up.
Ohhhhz, you so bad
wassup hommie, how the fuck have you been?

Always a fun process. I'm thinking about starting a batch of mead sometime soon.
Hope you have a blast, bummed I cannot make it. Not sure I have the gas to make it through till I get paid, here's hoping.
Yup, it's armed robbery
So glad I live on the other side of the country, how many people did you run over?
Try a potato launcher of sorts, the kind that relies on air pressure. This probably won't make the peep go far, but it SHOULD shoot. I know they sell ones that shoot ping pong balls, which theoretically would work for peeps, someone test it out.
Sadly, my other option is to do summer classes so I can get the eff done with school.
It is just as terrible as the Florida version and will have the same likely consequences of racist shootings.
hook it up with a summer job :-D.
Tatt even. So bloody tired of autofix.
Simple solution, crash into the nearest mountain and no more zombie. Woot.
I'll email you a copy, when I have it all finished. Just remind me :-P
There ya go, $15 a day, compared to whatever you get at work. Shitty exchange, even if you are currently making minimum wage.
So you want to have you time wasted, lack of being able to go to your job, or see your children, all for what, $50 a day, or is it less?
Especially since my research led me to find the case of Clairvius Narcisse, a man who "died" in 1962, yet walked into his home village 18 years later. Look it up, pretty interesting stuff about the origins of the zombie and how zombies ARE created as slave labor, in Haiti.
I'm just glad I was able to convince my teachers that my paper is academic gold, versus having to write about something boring, like damned taxes or something.
Academic even. Stupid coffee needs to hit my blood stream faster.
or even anti-establishment, pro drug, pro crime, something.
Damn, you got a double header today. You need to come off as a racist P.O.S. and they may not call upon you, again.

Totally digging it., looks awesome.

Why in the world would you have been shivering with it at a whopping 27 degrees. That's like being in the tropics ;-)
Doggie style is always a fun dance. Way to be :-D
Lucky bastard, I wanna go jump out of a perfectly good plane.
Really? I had to do that months ago. It really isn't that bad, although it DOES take some getting used to.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I've witnessed sex on the dancer floor myself.
It looks amazing.
Sadly while marijuana is legal medicinally, on a state to state basis, it IS still federally illegal so they probably got strong armed into it by the Feds, who have higher jurisdiction and thus make Oakland PD their bitches. Further proof, I believe, that democracy is an imaginary form of government.
I think that Jim Carrey's humor died years ago, he's just a washed up hack trying to make himself relevant again. It'll be a HUGE flop.

Probably for the best that I didn't swing by, already warned him about what would happen to him if he hurt you. We ALL know he's a lowlife, but some of the things I've heard doomed him to a swift kick to the nuts and a knee to the face. Miss you kiddo.

I was looking at the stats from other schools, UF has a bit over 50,000 students and had a turn out of over 1000. I have already tossed the idea towards the English department, one of my sources is about how a UF library used the game to run missions to promoted learning proper research skills, etc.
Weren't we all. I was trying to get to the damned fire all night :-P
Nice find Anthony, there I burn.
I'm sure the eca team will ensure that he doesn't cause problems on their sets. They are always super amazing
I can't believe I'm still watching this. This guy is actually a truly terribly individual. How the fuck does he get ANY work.
Hahaha, oh I see, he's a total douche.
I'm sorry 3/5 for my scholarly journals.
I should have a Ph.D in proper procrastination techniques. If I had procrastinated longer 3/4 sources would have been supplied to me, at no work to myself, FROM my professor.
I don't blame you, lol.
Ashley, I can help you with those, when you get back stateside. I have run through 6 sets, myself, and have developed a pretty solid technique for creating nice locks, fast.
Wait, is he the dude I heard about on TWD set that is super creepy to the ladies working the set?
So, I emailed my professor a question about one of my sources. He gets back to me hours later, deciding that my source is more than valid, it's the leading expert, plus he adds several sources that HE searched up. ;-) Refer back to master procrastinator and bow the hell down ;-).
I know Dukesy, you know it's sent right back. When yall tossing your kid my way?
I may not have the best, but it's as close to it as I have seen in many a moon.
I assure you, today was seized AND I got my work accomplished. Life is being lived to it's fullest, while still making my way through the semester with good grades :-D.
Boy isn't that the truth. :-D
but then I fail to seize the day, and it's school, it's really not that hard. Just a pain in the ass, at times.
the speech I winged today was stressful, this paper was not ;-). (I spoke with the professor about the speech, after the class and did quite well ;-)
I've pulled all A's for this class, all semester, doing this same thing. Plus this was the "easy" paper, as he described it. If it was something that required me to actually think, I wouldn't have waited as long.
Yay, power's back. Judging by the 80,000 sirens, someone wrapped themselves around a telephone pole, hope they're alright.
FUCK YOU POWER OUTAGE. That's what I get for bragging before I was finished. Good thing I'm on my laptop, albeit with little battery power.
doesn't hurt that I'm doing my bit on the zombie apocalypse. Actually all of my major projects follow that theme, this semester. I planned ahead, all the research for my projects can be used for multiple assignments ;-).
Procrastination is like masturbation, you are only fucking yourself, but both are loads of fun ;-)
That's super shitty.
tell us how you really feel.
< experienced it right after 9/11 due to nail files. 4 National Guards with mp5's pointed at me, finger on the trigger.
I hope you never get that experience, too.
And may even get to know how it would feel to have guns pointed at you.
YES!! They most certainly will and you will likely face severe legal reprecussions from it.
Boy aint that the truth. Thanks Lori, would be awesome to have a copy, again.
I wish I still had that video, but alas it got eaten by the evil VCR of doom.

Yeah man, no problem.
I have the season pass from iTunes, used my iPad to take screen shots to tag.
I'm not sure who that is, honestly.
But the fire felt mighty nice :-D.
Yeah, that made him really easy to find in the episode, very distinctive.
That's how you get all the boys, showing off your sexy face.
no problem :-D
Hit play 2x to advance the clip by a frame or two, slider bar cause I missed, rinse and repeat.
Best Idea I had, many of the pics turn out WAY darker on the comp than on my Ipad, but no biggie.
No problem man, I got I think one more screen shot with you, thus far. Really hard to sync my Ipad to the exact time, the slider bar moves in incriments of 3, lol.
right on, i'll pull something up later, my b for the wrong tag.
Is that not you back there?
I'm pretty sure there is a photo with me drooling all over myself. Considering how much of the night that was occurring, it's a fair bet :P.
What an awesome moment for team zombie :-D
glad you could link to the rest of em Amanda.
Touché, but they do seem to be following the comics fairly closely, from my understanding, so I'm betting he's a winner.

Fuck yes I am totally getting this game, lol.
That is awesome and all too true.
They have no proof and i got it all worked out. It only took being on hold for 3 hour long rounds, lots of cussing and one hell of a headache.
Dude, you should come to Momocon with me and some buds this weekend.
Not really sure, the LSD would add a sure level of illegality to it, but not sure if it would constitute as assault. Honestly, I suppose they could press charges for it, although they would look retarded. Then again, they are protesting the right to choose what you do with your pregnancy, so they must not be too bright to begin with.
Seriously dude, you need to come to Momocon with me and some buds this weekend.
Or if you want to REALLY up the ante... Dose the balloons with LSD and open their eyes to the beauty of the world.
Yup, water baloons filled with water + food coloring, stain the shit outta their shirts.
Sorry man, hope it gets better for you.

Yeah, I didn't get hired to eat shit, just make drinks.
I said that I would see him, tomorrow and his reply was "I'll let you know" gonna take that as him firing me. He'll have to tell me, tomorrow, cause I'm totally gonna show up.

yup, looks like the non-thinking mac user won that battle of wits. ;)
Oh build your own PC, for those that have too much time on their hands and no friends.
Oh PC the computer for the man who can't afford something built to last.
Can always sub-let the room for a bit ;-)
it's brutal
You should look up shot glass chess ;-)
I'm going to check around the Inman park area for a big house. See what we can do :-D.
Just one more reason I'm glad I have a Mac.
No kidding, have an awesome carpool setup, for sure. I think we'll all be pretty set for the zombie apocalypse too, we'll just use the blend in method of survival ;-).
*FB super long bear hug*
Hope that funk got broken ;-)
Awesome sauce.
I'm also looking, we should all shoot for a house in the city :-D. Bet we can find an awesome place, for a decent price.
Well I am glad that I rank in among the cool peeps that keep you on here. You should stick around, we have lots of smiles and laughter to offer you.
Yall coming closer to the city?
I had a feeling the SOPA thing was just a magician's misdirect to cover something else. There was no hope that bs would pass, this is what we missed by focusing entirely on SOPA. Big brother is out to get us, we need to put an end to this shit.
You should be DAMN proud of who you are. You are the shiznit kiddo.
Damnit I forgot about that, I was planning on going with yall. My b.
I miss that show :(
It's amazing
Looking like a true gangsta.

Careful Lasse, she's trying to buy your pig for the little sausage.
You should see me when I go out, no woman's touch involved, till later.
Look at those two movie stars.
Hope you have a great night with Quagmire.
I agree with Heather, it just shows that they have the fighting spirit. While it might piss the government off and further the cause, slightly. It shows an unbreakable spirit and puts the power back where it belongs, with the people. In any other country even proposing something so retarded as SOPA would create riots. The government should be afraid of the people, not the other way around. Revolution is near, I feel a change in the winds.
Hellz yeah man. Although we are probably now BOTH on the watch list. Although I've been there for years, I'm sure.
the best part is he answers himself too.
That's cause you IS the boss.

That is the funniest damned movie, lol. They depict meth addicts as pot smokers, it's ridiculous.
Have a blast.
They are one of my fav bands to see live. They at Variety Playhouse Thursday, but in savannah the night before
What really disturbs me is that Nickleback is playing with decent bands. Those bands should know that association with Nickleback may cause a loss of fans.
you and me both. All done with class for the day, now just to sit around and wait till 2 for work :(
Have fun on the beach for me. Needing some sand in my life, soon
yay spell check, thanks for failing me yet again
Well put Caleb. :-D
There is no way this will pass. As someone that is familiar with magician's tricks, this could be just a bit of misdirection. I'm going to do some research and see if there is anything else that is on the docket that might be worse.
Caleb is right, it's just another "terror" scare. Frankly, every time I see a big issue like this, I wonder what they are sneaking in under the radar. Mass panic over something that they won't end up passing, yet during this time I bet something worse DOES get passed that we don't know about until it's too late. Just sayin
And don't forget the tools holding the weapons, they are paid, by us, but work for the douche bags that are screwing all of us. Military needs to pull it's head out of it's ass.
Fuck yes they should fear us. Problem is, they know we're pussies, and they got a LOT of bullets, tazers, rubber bullets, tear gas and all sorts of weapons of pain and destruction.
Oh... and almost got canned today for talking to a guy that came in with his congress badge on.
;)
I have called AND written to every single one in our state, already
Yeah, gotta love those anonymous type folkers. They get the damned job done, while the rest of us sit on our lazy butts hoping that this will all go away
This is going to get ugly REALLY fast me thinks.
;-)
yup, i'm now on the watch list
Funny thing is that in Europe they would riot... Here we just sit back and bitch, hense why they push our lazy asses around.
You were in my neck of the woods and didn't freaking tell me? Bastard
I can't wait to see what they have planned if this bill actually goes through ;-)
Yayo... Not to mention we pay their fucking salaries... In any other place that makes us THEIR bosses.
I know right? woulda been super fun. The problem is they had the football game on, so none of the songs came through the Jukebox. I feel cheated lol
Hey now, lets all just get along.
If you value the freedom of speech period, do it. These acts will destroy our last viable civil liberty that sets America apart from the rest of the world.
And ruin all our fun? Why would we want to do that?
Really? I can only see hilarity ensuing from that
If this is a free county, why is everything for sale? To go along with that, with 2% of the global population, how come we have a whopping 25% of the global population of people locked up in jail?
Me neither.
what time man?
My pleasure. Yall gotta come kick it in the city sometime. :-D
And a lack of herpes (hopefully) that shit don't go away?
Meh, as long as they do it well...

You are welcome, my child ;)
Thanks Poly :p You feeling better?
Woot woot.

nah, people would sing to taht one, not bad enough
Kris Kros is up, then Macarena
of course you are, you's always on set.
Yup, it's time for some Enya
Heather Lynn Kinikin that song is so terribad that it won't come up on my app
the app will send the song to the box. Tried to turn it into a juggalo night, but it will NOT accept ICP
Nickleback into "all by myself" both eric carman and celine deion.. haha, I'm an ass.
Thanks Christopher Kelly
BINGO... beautiful. I got an app that I can take over the jukebox at the bar, lol. Gonna make it play some absolute SHIT.
Oh yeah, freaking awesome.
I can, although can only do it on the weekend. I have 14 hour days 5 days a week.
Booo, sorry to here that my friend.
Ahhh stupid phone app forget the ? Damnit
Hahahha well played heather?
:P
I think i've heard you say a couple of those, lol.
That sounds like a blast, when is it exactly?
Thanks for the inv man. Will have to kick it sometime soon.
Heading out to the bars again with the boys. Gonna get a little crazy again
Bam, glad you getting back on your feet.
you know the number if you feel a little froggy later.

Just be on the watch out for it. Literally the only times I've made attempts at my life were on Wellbutrin or Zoloft, not sure which it was at the time.
Or in layman's terms, totallypussyitis.

Hey man, as I remember you used to resemble that statement.
That just sounds dirty, lol.

Speaking of which... If you are bar capable, 9pm Stout on Thurs, tis a bday bar hopping night. Friday shall kick my ass I'm sure. Thank god for redbull.
Well I'm calling whoever fat.
It sure was interesting. Although not quite as odd as the hooker that spit a load of jizz in the trash one morning. Her pimp shoulda backhanded her for that. Clearly he had paid her for the job with a heroin high, she shoulda done the polite thing and swallowed, isn't that what he paid her for?
A severe need for sleep. This semester is 12 hour days m-f :-D
No, I asked him to leave the store, lol.
Speaking of which... it's WAY past time I did so lol.
@Leah Taylor I work at Smoothie King, I load caffiene into my drinks. lol
Oh man, that sounds like a tough job Lasse Linno Henriksen, it must be..... hard ;)
Right back atcha Amanda.
I reccommend going for the most storage you can afford. It's amazing how fast 16 gigs is gone. Then again, if you want to just keep fav bands on it, 16 should prolly keep you comfy with space. Videos will fill it up fast though.
Pfff, Pats, really? They lost it all the the Giants and you STILL root for them? lol.
It's people like him that put us in this shite economic position we are in. Spoken like a true inbred hillbilly there, always seeking to blame someone else, especially if they are black. I support the sterilization movement. Let's spread the word.

That might, or might not have been a hint to folks
Amazing, plus the kids won't fall into the pool and drown.
There are confirmed Zombies that shall be in attendance. Oh yeah. :P
I hear Mission Impossible music playing at the thought of them trying to keep me in a hotel, in A-dam. Time to go stealth mode.

It's only 945 there. Smoke a fat rock of crack and explore, plenty of time to sleep on a damned plane

We gonna party down tomorrow though. Awwww right.

Of that I had no doubt, lol.
lol, usually girls are happy about the opposite. Congratulations :-D
She's not just stupid, she's from California.
seriously though, I bet you can get your adviser to help with that. That's really shitty that they are going to fuck you over because you pay to get a degree and it's part of the program.
Tell us how you really feel.

BOOOOOO
I probably won't be able to make either, but we shall see. Should be working fulltime next week, on top of full time student. :(
Talk about cold, what a douche. It's sad that assholes like that are the ones in power in our country.
I told you to stop doing blow. WTF
You should just train your butt off, like me, to do the tough mudder and the run for your lives 5k endurance runs.
That is really bloody nifty. Although those poor guys MUST be freezing their nuts off.
At least your flatulence shall keep the poor fellow wrapped in a warm blanket of nastiness
Which way is the beach?
Ummm, perhaps your kiddo... Jareth ;)
I refuse to believe that Jamie ;).
Yeah, she thanked me for not checking to see if she was packing. Told her, I wasn't anywhere near drunk enough to be that curious.
She was SUPER nice. Apparently people kept giving her the aussie handshake.
Didn't ya get the memo? Geek is the new sexy
All I know is they either are shooting, or have shot, on the street I work at.
I bet you are, it's freaking cold out. Is this the scene they want Luckie st for?
Please keep me posted to, would be fun.
Good for you man, just finished my first semester back, myself.
Damn man, it only took me 6 ;). Bout to get the damned kuzzoo outta my car, too. Ya for not having to give my car a blow job to start it.
I bet your goats are terrified. I think the first lady is the best, she's plainly staring, then licks her lips. In her post prank interview she says she was "disgusted." Her body language shows something else entirely.
They all look so short compared to you.
It's always nice to start your day with a bang. Plus your skin looks great after the facial.
I miss my monkey, it breaks my heart that I missed her b-day. At least she looks happy.
Well, if you did your job right, it wouldn't take longer.
I agree, that's probably a super collectors item. She needs to nerd up.
Total awesomeness for sure. I wanna go this year :P
but it's true, you don't need a boyfriend, just a manfriend :P
Totally just liked where I saw a like, didn't even look for anything other than the like button. Makes it really ironic :P
Lol I figured you, Amber and Lasse would have a hayday with the waiter prank video.
Amber, you are slipping, I expected a like or something WAY earlier. Or perhaps a comment on the rediculous prank video I posted on my profile, that goes for you too Lasse Linno Henriksen and Katt Winter.
Bad way to preform an abortion, they have clinics for that.
did your goat propose to you?
hope you are ready for the cold, temp dropped out the bottom of us back in Ga.
Still hate you a little bit, lucky bastard.
What a great photo of Savana Jade Wehunt, I think it really shows her sexy face.
As far as I know, yes. Parents want to talk about it, however. If something changes I'll let you know, but I am pretty sure I can handle the home end.
Hope you can make it this weekend. Looks like double b-day AND pre-semester.
that's terribad
Lasse, you messed up and sent everyone's to me. I was kind enough to put em on ebay, for you.
I have a friend that has literally been stock piling ammo for years. A garage fire at their place would be a REALLY bad occurrence resulting in a lot of shrapnel, lead and probable death.
Hope you have your zombie survival kit, as well as SUPER winter gear in case of an ice age. Surviving a meteor collision would be much harder to plan for. Nuclear events too, for that matter. Either way, I'll see you on the other side of the Apocalypse. :-D
Rage Vegas with a vengance, become a high roller at the table, and buy a massage chair, just cause. Also, get on more TV shows so I have more $$ for the Nightlife.
Actually, after having been in a failed marriage with no prenup, that is basically what happens anyways.
That COULD apply more to men than women, depending on what state you are in. A Texan girl would be stupid not to. Don't have anything to gain now... but in the future...
Failure to consider a prenup is a terribad idea and a fast way to be screwed should things go poorly

Sounds like Bank of America, which is ironic because my card was charged a total of $1600 in Spain. I haven't ever been off the continent and somehow that was NOT fruad. Careful with them, they lull you into a false sense of security with that practice.
That's like 30 min or so right? You cover gas and that's np.
I could, not working Tues.
Ewwwwwww goat porn.

Yeah, i'm running out of places to hide the bodies too. Sad state of affairs. I think we should invest in a pig farm, yes Lasse we can have goats too.
Dude, you need to write a book, that was epic.
That keyboard would make it ~ 5 minutes in my house.
there should be way more of them.
Oh well, never mind then. no traveling for you. even in an imaginary world filled with nerd rage and trolls
probably
Idk, from what I hear you may do a lot of travel in Azeroth.
Welcome to the party Lasse, took you long enough to chime in. I vote for the stripping, that way you keep your trick AND make money. Could even create a traveling goat show.
Take a shower filthy hipster
I was gonna say it's called Bachelor pad carpeting.
I like the way you think. Good for you.
did he do the BB trick too?
Wow, who needs testicular cancer when you can just go straight for the shaft.

haha, awesome
I'll be there, if yall wanna train for tough mudder together I'm down.
So knock his ass out and take the flag. A little real blood will do well for him as a zombie ;-)
25$ to be a zombie vs i think it's 120$ reg registration. Problem is as a zombie you aren't included in the official times of the race, but you do get special swag.

I always wondered what goat herders fantasized about. Now that I know, I wish that lasse had kept quiet.
Hey now, he's just giving you some pro-tips, don't take offense from him trying to help you rape goats more efficiently.
She could totally skip the roofie step if she got herself a fainting goat. It roofies itself every time there's a loud noise. Get a goat fucker drum and she's got the whole herd knocked out.
TROLLS ATTACK!!!!!!!!!!!!
She just uses the roofies cause it excites her more.
Can't really figure out if that's for naughty list, or good list people.
We all know she loves BoB, he rocks her world

Yeah bitch do something funny for us. Preform monkey *sits expectantly*
Death to all humans. Must eat brains
Yeah, I know. Life been kicking my arse a bit. last final is Friday. busy busy till then.
Good for you.
They should make booger flicking an olympic sport. Sine nose picking is #3 on your list I'd bet you are pretty good at it.
It's coming my friend, worry not. Frankly I think the slowness of this season is partly due to them doubling the amount of episodes, yet not getting double the budget.
Dude, I met Capt Planet... It's really a drag king, fyi, she's super nice.
That woudl explain a lot. good times
Now you have two
Me too, albeit a super hung over bum, but a bum non-the-less.
Nothing new about that Gary.
Get those coorporate bastards.
I fully support making an abosolute fool of yourself, just not at the cost of supporting microsoft's shitty experience.
Well any company that competes with microsoft ;-)
Meh, maybe I'm just a microsoft hater, but my 360 lasted literally 2 days outside the warrenty, after eating a game because I had it standing on end (which they say in the manual will keep it cooler, but do not say that it will eat games, aka false advertising and refusal to do anything about the destroyed game other than tell me to buy a new one) and refused to fix it since warrenty expired 2 days prior. Been 100% apple since.
Yeah, but microsoft makes shit, so as you won't have a warrenty, and they probably wouldn't honor it anyways (yes I do have experience with that) he should give it for $150.

I would love to come, hook a bother up/
Haggle that Microsoft piece of shit.
That's freaking awesome. Please teach me the joys of doing the stunt gig. I want to be light on fire, tossed out of a window, hit by a car, thrown off a cliff, etc. Hook a brother up
Good for you, congratulations
LMFAO. That's a good marketing plan for them. Put weed IN the cookies and people will go ape shit.
That is pretty bloody funny for sure.
What a tardfacealol that is pretty damned funny
That thing is freaking AWESOME.
Thanks for having us out, it was an amazing experience. Can't wait till next season starts shooting.
That is an awesome story
Have fun
Damn, dude is an amazing public speaker.
It's people like her that make the occupy movement more powerful. Look back at all the great peaceful protest sucesses of all times, Ghandi, MLK, what do they all have in common? They all got the SHIT kicked out of them over and over, but did not give in. If mass violence happens on the police side, it means they win.
Damnit yall, now I'm hungry.
All good really
I heard one at the bar that was priceless. Dude walks up to a lady at the bar, takes her by the hand, looks into her eyes and says (direct quote) "How bout you and me go back to your place where I will lick your p***y all night, just the way you like it." This line ended with her punching him, of course. I almost died laughing. Guys like that are around to simply make those with sense look better.
Negative Nancy is back out to play huh?
So let me save up a touch and get in on the 3 machine a month bid :P.
That's why I tend for waffle house. Can stay as long as I need.
Agreed, booo.
Love me some Ren Fest.
awesome, lol
Damn that looks amazing. *drools*
Right back at ya.
My phone is glitched to hell, can only keep service for like 30 secs at a time
Dangit did I miss it already?
Amber if you spend as much time on twatter as you claim, you have no excuse not to know of trolling.
Amber is a bit slow, huh. All good, she can join the troll army
You have my permission to troll with the best.
Well if you slept with someone in legal at least you'd be getting some from someone other than B.O.B
I totally will. Look forward to seeing you on set somewhere again.
I wouldn't say that anywhere near Georgia, them's be fighting words
sounds like my weekend.
Totally awesome :P
awesome, lol.
Precious.
You bring sophistication to an entirely new level
Aye me too. Can't wait till next season's call backs :-D
Ouch, hope you feel better.
NyQuil, NyQuil, NyQuil we love you you giant fucking Q.
Extras casting Atlanta, acme casting, cherrix casting. Find them on FB easy from there.
Yeah but I am earning it in extras holding reading my book and eating.
Yup, Tyler Perry House of Payne. Havent done a damned thing all day.
I DID have to wake up at 6am to be here. Totally in zombie character. @ Cait we gots to get together after we get paid, snag a brew or two.
Never heard back from them. Working House of Payne instead.
So far they feed really well. Breakfast is amazing.
I don't know you anymore. That series is garbage.
I got a few others, Cherrix and a couple others
How's that like your life?
Lol. Awww Right... giggity goo
Yeah go friends in ATL
Specially since we're up to what 14 years?
Hellz yeah, was awesome getting to know you on set.
Yay. Damned T virus had us all pretty hurting.
Why sadface?
Make some cool shit dude.
but that's totally badass
I'm sure I'll get backup about the *drool* part of my zombie imitation.
how's THAT like my life :-P.
*zombie groan* *drools*
gogo Mer-bitch
Hahaha, that's freaking awesome.
Damn man, that's bs. Had that happen to me a few years back, got screwed to the tune of 3k by the time the lease ended.
Aye, but with no author no abomination, either way they all gots to go.
Yeah, that wasn't very funny aside from the gay camera man.
Awesome, we gots to hang while you are here :-D.
Yeah, waiting on the conformation from them. Either way I have work.
Then again as I am on a budget, how much is the rent, lol.
hehe, at least you know if you had to do a plane evac at 15,000 you totally could and would love it.
If you didn't live in Lawrenceville I would totally consider it.
Have a safe trip Jenna Jaffart
Probably, zombies were amazing.
He might just like it
Gotta get home and apply, but I'm betting they will.
Haven't in a while but want to get back out. You back in Atl?
Glad I'm not the only one that thought that looked more than a little bit like you.
Never got close enough to find out how much the cardboard wads hurt, but I'll believe it, for sure.
Would make it easier if we weren't just crazy
I know right? Pity he doesn't live in the city, would love to snag a beer with that man.
He's a true brew professional and funny as hell.
me 2, would be ridiculously fun, as long as the Police don't start shooting at us with REAL bullets. I would imagine that might hurt.
Or we could just meetup and get in full makeup and randomly invade someplace new each week. Zombie apocolypse begins when the show is on break
Spose I'll just have to start watching Dexter on time, lol.
HAHAHAHA Brian that's freaking hilarious
bwahahaha, yeah they loved using you as a hero
Yeah man, leaving it open to make one hell of a mid season finale.
That was a really intense episode.
That is pretty nifty. great article
I freaking love that movie. Really feel it's his best
Awwww, now I miss John Candy. Thanks Melisssa
Daniel I think you selling yourself short. Remember she's an actress, she can prolly swing more than 5$ for that happy ending.
Hellz yeah. Was an amazing experience and one that I look forward to repeating next season :-D.
That IS pretty awesome, lol.
Just remember that he lived a long time before baths were so easy to take. You probably would have licked the dirt from under his finger nails. Back then, that was a woman's place
I agree 100%. Such a drastic switch in schedules, was pretty rough on my system.
Yeah, took a bit, for sure. Feeling much more alive now.
Yeah, agreed. Sleeping on the bus kinda hurt a bit too.
Group: Atlanta Zombie/Horror/Sci Fi Group
My point exactly Robbie, they will just kick us out, provided they can find us all ;)
Lol, yeah it was pretty rough, for sure. My back is killing me from all the crazy zombie positions I was in.
That is freaking awesome. What sort of renewable energy do you specialize in? Wind, solar or other?
What, being undead wasn't a vacation?
Whoa dude why the hell are you driving so slow? I can run faster than this, step it up.
Umm listening to finger nails on a chalkboard would probably be an improvement.
Group: Atlanta Zombie/Horror/Sci Fi Group
I still have my doubts they could do much more than kick us out. Will look into the legality of walking around in full makeup. Frankly I would imagine that morphsuits would be illegal if full facial coverage was illegal. I have the week off school do have tons of time to get this fully figured out.
Now we know who's REALLY in charge at your house.
Group: Atlanta Zombie/Horror/Sci Fi Group
Awesome, looks amusing.
Can't wait till next season starts filming and we get to see what yall makeup wizzes do to jack us up again :-D
lol gotta love southpark
IDK why but Hello kitty is all the rage currently.
So Pizza is no longer considered junk food... AWESOME.
Listen friend as you pass by, as you are now so once was I. As I am now, so you will be. Prepare yourself to follow me
lol, you and your coloring books

HAHAHAHA, flash mob zombie dancing.

Lots of good ideas flowing here. Gives me some things to look into. Do we have any makeup types that would be willing to help get zombies ready?

Aye, hit Lenox on Black Friday or something

Thank you, thank you.
Yeah, I'm curious as to how you got stuck, I have never heard of anyone who got stuck once, let alone twice.
Glad that you are having a great time.
Reiki heading your way.
bloody mary sounds awesome
dirty
Your vibe is a model of a goat penis? you twisted sistah.
Ummm, cause he was up all night kicking it with us on set. and is probably sleeping like I'm about to be... Coffee high fading.
How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsy roll?
I couldn't agree more.
yeah man sure am
Wait till the season finale ;-)
I mean that we finished shooting the season finale last night.
That might have something to do with the temp being below freezing. But what do I know.
Ruh roh, no more Bali shag in the near future?
Nothing wrong with bartending... Just Red Robin
Oh no. Hope you feel better.
Yeah I'd be scared of us for sure.
Bet you enjoyed the dingle berry flavor to

Fuck that, get one of the cars from Mad Max. You'll be safe then ;-)
Wow, some kid's family tree doesn't fork.
Holy crap. Glad you are ok.
I agree 100%.
hell yeah it does. Totally gonna snag the first book when TWD check comes.
Did you use syrup or jam?

Not sure when this will be possible.. My parents are kinda being douchey, threatening to kick me out because I missed two days of school and am clearly "not mentally healthy."(direct quote from my pops

Well played sir

I think the true irony is that as a long time physician he doesn't see the legitimate medicinal use of the plant. Nor sees that removing it from the black market would mean that the great "gateway drug" is no longer around the other, nastier drugs. Or perhaps that the REAL drug that is statistically the first used would be alcohol or cigarettes.
Wait.... DAMN YOU.... you tricked me into procrastinating more. FML
Not even the virus from Resident Evil? I can promise you the gift of eternal life.
abs even
Meh, the T virus took care of that. Funny story, abbs look AMAZING when the flesh of your belly decays.
Yeah, be right there give me like 3 months for the walk.
There. Now you BOTH got a poem.
roses are red
violets are black
you ladies
are clearly smoking crack
Oh baby, oh baby.
No more procrastination for me, off to write a paper. Have fun jilling off to what's his nuts.
sad
So that's what the kids are calling bumping uglies these days
How does his furnature look from the lawn?
RL, durh. Don't get a real view of his insides in pretend land. Send him my way, I know a few zombies that will be happy to tell you how he looks inside. You may not get him back in good working order though
And Katt when was the last time you were buried deep inside him?
I also might add that apparently some of the fan mail he gets includes MUCH stranger offers/photos. He wouldn't tell the stories though.
Totally couldn't make that happen, not allowed to bring my phone on set. Sorry my dear but he's taken and not into the bacon thing. Super nice guy though and really funny.
ummm, YES. Last night was the first night of the week that wasn't around 30 degrees outside.
Pussy. I worked a 14 hour day, went to school, and now have to write a paper. Don't really remember the last time I got a great night's sleep.
My little one has that too ;-).
I have already been killed like 4 times in the past week

We don't get a wrap party so thinking bout tossing one either this weekend, or next. Will keep everyone posted.
nice, glad you could freak someone out. I keep wanting to stop at Waffle House in full makeup
not for another 15 minutes
Did you still have some makeup on or something?
Or wet who ha
just not sex with another human being :P
well, that KIND of is the smell of sex, since it's really the woman that creates much of the sex smell.

Ok, I'll see what I can do to get one happening ;)
Group: [SSDP@GSU] Students for Sensible Drug Policy at Georgia State
Well they would surely be invited.
Right so all of them. My question is did some of them use your nose and ears?
They told me they did a trick and got em all in you at once.
What about that one time, in the back of the van, with the entire globetrotters team. You mean to tell me those tricky bastards couldn't take it to the hole?
Not allowed to post them until after the season is over.
Cool, shall see you tonight then.
Are you working TWD this week?
I am that drooling creation. And glad to not be covered in my own drool.
Nope, but I have met both Rick and Carl. Gotta say Carl is the nicest kid ever.
I'm dead too. Threw a party last night and didn't sleep till 7 am... again.
I have been on the set of the Walking Dead. It has been amazing. Haven't really slept in 3 days, but it's cool.
Cheetos are heavenly too.
You know we loves you.
Holy shit I wanna live here
I think this lady is serious about her brownies.
Hey, I didn't come up with the label, just used it appropriately.
I am really jealous, that should be an amazing time.
You are such a sitophiliac.
Seems like a cliche theme to me, plus we all know that would never work out.
Yup, your followers probably just jumped a bit.
Yeah, back to the goth crap. I'm worried about you now.
Now you look all smart and stuff. Well done :-D
Yeah, was going to say something about that profile pic. Kinda looking sorta gothlike in that pic. What's the dealio, you going all emo on me?
and yes, it was wonderful :-D
step ahead of you.

Pfff, skimping on the goods. I refuse to buy.
Lots of juice and some chicken noodle soup is just what the dr ordered.
Become a zombie and stumble around chasing after living creatures.
And Mr Troll, you should be ashamed of yourself. Clearly San Fran is cooler than LA, and the 90's were awesome. Not the 90's fault you spent it inside your hs locker. Blame the football team, not the 90's
way to bring out the negativity to fb Katt. I was worried that it was under it's daily negativity quota till I read your post.
Does it come with a plane ticket?
I totally just got to goto my English teacher, apologize as tell him that I was leaving class to go be a zombie for the Walking Dead.
But of course I did. Quite lovely, in fact.
Nice, so effectively your "friend" has kissed your asshole. Hope it's someone that you don't like, at least
Meh, chocolate cake is plenty good enough for me.
Wow. Totally missed the last part of that with the first read. This is what happens when I'm reading facebook and seriously doing homework.
Just like a woman, promising things she doesn't intend to give, for chocolate.
Yet you understood it just fine :-D
HOLY AWESOMENESS !! seriously check this out, it's hilarious.
Yeah, we all know you are bass ackwards
Why can't you be cool like this Amber Bunn
If you like stars CHECK THIS OUT.
Amazing bubble pop.
I'm going to go ahead and guess a lot. But keep in mind, that is just a guess.
A midget without a sense of humor is like a whore that practices abstinence, It's just plain wrong in the eyes of god.
And might I add that is a way dirty dreamy night ;)
Yes it sure does.
Did you forget your drunken ramble the other day. You told me all about how you were a Morphophiliac?
Or maybe you should stop sleeping with midgets. Might end up with a better lay.
Did someone have a crazy drunken night? or just bear witness to someone living life in the danger zone again?

What did you say about my momma?

That is like the camel tail, almost. Nasty clam burger IMO.
Looks like Melbourne, Australia is the place I must go for chem major. Unless I take a summer in Italy, why not both ;-).
You and me both.
Rock on, good for you.
of what?
hehe sounds fun.
In countries where prostitution is legal rapes are statistically lower than where it is illegal.
Ireland and London are totally bucket list places.
np
yeah, do both, Oblivion was awesome
both?
Ahhh, so you can write it off as community service, cool.
Meh, it's AJ, she's probably off on an unplanned adventure that will lead her into Queens.
Dude, with her sense of direction, she probably got lost on the plane and found herself deep in the underbelly, where they hide all the zombies.
Shoot, I was under the impression it was a pants party, musta missed the memo
I'm sure the parents will really appreciate you giving their kids hardcore drugs
Love the gypsy look, fits you well.
at least you fucking made it this time.
No, it'll smell like shit covered pumpkin. AKA Pumpkin Spice Laté
Love this shit kiddo
There is a similar procedure called a windectomy. Basically a window is installed in their stomach so they can see WITH their head still firmly planted in their rectum.
careful, he'll prolly put it in YOUR ass for that. may even use super glue for lube.
Hell yeah you best.. Would be really bad to piss the Great Pumpkin off.
Oh no hear comes the Crimson Tide, everyone RUUUUUUN!!!!!!!
Super nice bike, so jealous.
Give a woman an inch and she'll talk your ear off.

Probably a TON of them. You could also use chocolate or OJ. Make sure he stays away from broccoli and asparagus.
Well then you should have a GREAT time. Just remember WWWD.
Sweet. Sounds fun. Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Well then you might not get harassed, don't forget the sunscreen, and warm clothes.
Well you'll be awake then, won't you. By the time you got here wouldn't need coffee. Just a lawyer for parental neglect. See you in 3 months.
Plenty left at my house... Start walking.
Pity the local solidarity protest got shutdown. All in jail, park now surrounded by a barricade.
*sips coffee* I can make morning coffee just fine, thanks. You just don't get any.
Does it please you in that special way? Make you feel butterflies in your stomach as it brews. That warm tingle across your body as you pour. Does it make you scream in pleasure at first sip? if not... your coffee maker needs to be replaced with one that can give it to you good.
Well then fuck your coffee machine if you love it so much
well it's daylight, so you can prolly afford to put the batts back in, and take care of the busy not having sex thing. Hop to it.
Yikes that's like her debut video 3 girls, one toilet. And what about B.O.B he's always ready
What a cool art project.

Such a Negative Nancy Amber. I'm seriously worried about that.
I'm jealous of the mussels.
Yes I am.
Yeah, but afterwords she could say that she did some community service on her resume.
Very good question. Probably to entice the people that can't imagine them being fake?

I hope you told the child that you were actually 80000 years old and were around to see the formation of the universe
I can... I take them for seriously stupid.
Gambit not being a pussy like he was in the Wolverine movie.

You're just jealous because I have 100+ souls to sell when I reach hell.
Only a few of them. I collected souls for a while. Figured I could buy some salvation someday.

Of course they are... BoA is the worst bank ever.
Yeah will be a good time, for sure.
HOLY CRAP SARA... THAT IS FREAKING AMAZING.
I bet at least ONE of your guy friends has had a "with holding" type relationship
Have just had one relationship since being back in GA, seems to be a true theory in many states. Hell, even comedians joke about it.
Agreed on that.
lol, yeah a few times
If that were true, people IN relationships would prolly get more of it.
and that was just me being me. The description of the costume to my acting teacher is what prompted me being in this for the pilot.
Well, yeah, totally ordinary... I had a blast with the filming... but it WAS for a tv pilot... THAT time. I have a similar outfit on in my dcon overflow from 09
Poor puppy. What happened?
That's freakin awesome.
Lol that's basically my dcon outfit. Was for a pilot episode of some tv show that never came to be.
Well played Tim. If one really thinks about it, there is one species that mates for life on the planet. The rest have that biological imperative thing going on.
And I'm sure they haven't shut up, either lol.
If that actually shut a girl up the divorce rate would probably be WAY lower.
Where are you finding these... they are gold.
Awesome, thanks for sharing.

No No, your back will limber up and it'll help with the back problems from bigger boobs. You'll be aight
Don't be a pussy. Pain is weakness leaving the body.
How you remind me isn't that bad.
and your ears are still unclean now
Just about everyone I've met knows at least one dead song, word for word. Even if they didn't know it was the Dead.
Congrats! Working on that myself.
Yeah, deff didn't phase me. Was busy doing the responsible adult thing... Have interview tomorrow. You can no longer say virgin ears Katt Winter!!! We ALL know they are diseased, now.
He's trying to give you AIDS of the ear... watch out
:P
What am i chopped liver?
Men get toys that can horribly maim/kill them. Women get toys that apply intense pleasure. Further proof that we are two different species.
Good luck with that. I suppose if you apply beatings for failures you could probably make it happen
Except you have to make the latte yourself... No self respecting queen would have that kind of set up. You need to work on the minions to do your bidding part of Queendom.
B.O.B always pleases ;)
No faking having a good time during your "sex" after the date.
Unfortunately I only found out after taking the first sip of the coffee I poisoned. Awesome
Best-o-luck to ya
Or cottage cheese. I had the same thing happen to me last week.
Good for you. I just don't order coffee most places
I miss my capuchinos.
I haven't had one since I quit sbux.
At least you don't have to pay $5 for your latte
I want an espresso machine. Would love to start my day with a cappuccino.
I bet it is, AJ... I bet it is.
And be careful :-D
Sounds like a good night..
:P neh, it's been fun with the long threads. You and Katt (who needs to get her ass off WoW and join in) have restored my faith in FB as an entertainment source
And once again we have a huge thread going on here :-P.
Not this year due to unforseen midew problem with my long johns. but if you look in the overflow from 09 my favored costume for Dcon is in there, at the end of the album.
You need to check out my Dragon Con 11 album... I found Gotham city
No that counts as extraordinary
Oh?? any special dreams?
Well when I make my billions I'll hook it up
And look, if I were MR Coke, you would be speaking with the Bat right now.
You're right... I'd be donning my cape, pulling out my cool toys and fighting crime as Batman.
I WISH... then you would be talking to me on my private island, with a margarita in my hand, and servants to do everything for me.
Not to be confused with Miami, different coke.
Atlanta is the city of Coke... It's in our blood.
FUCK NO... I wouldn't drink that garbage.
And hell no I don't say "pop" it's Coke, DURH
What did you say about my poppa?
I do not own a banjo... I DO, however, own a mandolin. Does that count?
Us southern folk have some fun phrases.
I'm sorry.
Touche... You would have to be to choose LA
I would have thought that would have hurt like the dickens, and possibly caused an infection, but what do I know.
I got pictures to prove it... Interesting piercing btw... did that hurt?
Liar, you were telling me yesterday about your patchouli bath that afternoon.
Then think of the Dali Lama you dirty Hippie
YAY it worked that time WOOOOOOOOOOOT!

why is my stupid link not working ??? sadface i don't get to use it twice :(
YAY... I get to use this one TWICE today...
Ok, so someone FINALLY capitalized on the lack of porn created for women. Hense you now get a soap opera with your porn.
It's soft core porn, at best. They just have a really involved story line, for a porno.
True brew.
She hasn't yet learned that Vampires used to be cool until Twilight and Tru Blood destroyed them.
Yeah, me too. As I noted, yesterday, it's almost worse than not talking to her, as I get to see what all I've missed. Was the first time I've heard her string 3 words together.
I think I would TOTALLY abuse my Jedi powers... "That's not the bar tab you are looking for"
While that could be, I fear that skynet's power to worry me has faded since they couldn't even keep their date of destruction. It's kind of like that blind date you had when the guy showed up months/years late, doesn't change much in your life.
Considering we've past the date when the apocolypse predicted in Terminator, I doubt that they are going to cause much problem.
Holy crap that's freaking awesome.
The irony is this whole thread started talking about your child's haircut video. I MAY have tainted the thread with the MJ reference
Yeah, that was a low blow. And she's down for the count
I actually get laid ;)
no YOU wish...
Already did.. remember, you're my epic mount
Eat 2 aderal and knit like a mofo
Now look what you started you WoW junkie
So when do I get MY hat?
yeah, totally jealous. you got me there.
see you can /talktoself or /knitgayhats
rehab here you come
lol... I knew you weren't cut out for quitting...
Man, yall are slow today... get with it
Yeah, that's what I was shooting for
They may have... But I was one of a very few tables partaking in the unlimited crab legs. So perhaps I was the hero that ensured that their legs didn't go bad
And every time you masturbate God kills a kitten... http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/God-kills-kitten.jpg
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/God-kills-kitten.jpg
but crab may have played a part
Yeah, I think it's the carpel tunnel from chronic masturbation.
it's official... my fingers are going on a damned diet.
HIS* damn my fat fingers
Yeah, aint I a stinker
IDK if his conception and New Moon have anything in common, it'll be he husband.
Group: Not Stalkers
The real question is was he conceived DURING the screening of New Moon? If so... He's doomed to be gay.
Group: Not Stalkers
Funny... I was just writing something to that effect
MJ would have, i'm sure.
Me too dude... You doing the Adult field day at Buckhead Saloon? Trying to get a team together, myself.
send me the link please. :-D
I DO HOLY CRAP
Funny I had the same theory and ate endless crab legs instead of doing mine.
Yeah, but MY books are easy to pack... And I can charge it with a potato and some Gatorade.
At least my kindle won't slow me down in the zombie apacalypse... tell that to your books..
I would love that too... until then, I'm going to live with the reality that it's way hard to move a ton of books
Kindle is WAY easy comparitively
Yeah... but you will hate them when you move... I have a VERY impressive library... 2 large rubber made containers full... it SUCKS to move them.
then I shall watch the show
I love my kindle... i found 4 book pack on sale... almost done with the 5th, now.
Yeah... I could give a spoiler alert... but...
the books are amazing.. George is an amazing writer.
I haven't seen the tv series... until then... so I can :-D
Really? they picked a TERRIBLE person for Daenerys... She's supposed to be like super hot... FAILBOT DESTROY!!!!
the books are amazing... who the fuck cares about the TV show
HAHAHA... must be Game of Thrones
just like the south park episode
Plus.. I'm just trying to teach you to read with my chicken loving
Hey I had me a butt load of crab legs... turned the chicken down tonight.
;)
What's that?
ya know it IS pretty amazing that this post is still going on... but we're just cool like that.
You mean those that you don't know very well?
Yeah, I was gonna party with him at Dcon last year but he was a bitch and bailed
Dude, when I lived in AZ that was every day life... I think... I can't remember much though... I was usually high.
I get awkward when I'm high. so THERE.
Katt you know you loving B.O.B... hard to text and vibe aint it
yeah, but you're lazy Katt
Hellz yeah. they are amazing... heading back next Sunday, if you care to join me.
Well you missed out anyways :( Sundays at Buckhead Saloon starting at 4p
Damn... Def not gonna make it.
You doing all 3? If I DO go, will probably just be hp40
Will have to train my ass off to be ready, but still a couple months.
WOOOT WOOT
WAHOO grats
Well I'm sure you can get a good friend (looking at you Katt) to do the dead for ya.
One can always solve that problem with a swift kick to the nuts
Congrats.. did yall win?
I can see it now... Meet a hot guy at the bar, and all of a sudden his clothes magically rip apart.
Sit on my face, and tell me that you love me.... sit on my face, and tell me that you care... I love to hear you oralize, while I'm between your thights, you blow me away.
Damn... I KNEW i forgot something...
Yeah... that's kinda a turn off... you REALLY need to work on negotiation skills. Good thing this isn't a hostage situation or something.
Do you get bored and answer the phone too?
Ok Paris Hilton
Does it include video?
It would appear so.
It's alway so boring on here. And btw... I expect a test drive.
Haha this has been a fun day on fb lol.
Depends on how good the sex is. ;-)
Is for horses
I doubt it has anything to do with THIS thread... but you can blame me, it's cool
:-P
And I would love the discount myself
Where do you think his crazy ass got the tiger's blood
your* damn these fat fingers
SUUUURE he did... You mean you watched you ex and her while tied up in the corner
How do you know she bangs like a demon? Have you tried her skills personally? or just done the creepy stalker thang and watched from her front lawn?
Well the we can have a polagamist type relationship.. although that means gotta move to Utah.
Well then... sign a brother up :-P
Katt's a good friend... she's advertising for you amber :-D
Sounds like a better arraingement than marriage... At least with her deal you get some ;-)
I KNEW you were all about the donkey show
Lol... yall are dirty
Tell em I told em they had to come and eat crab... and ENJOY it.. ;)
Well they need to learn that seafood is amazing... :P
Yeah... of crab legs... all you can eat... got a problem with that? :-D
You should bring the youngins and rock out on the crab legs with me :-D.
4 pm, and no kidding... stupid website said 12-3... but went up there and no damned legs till 4

No way... Crab beats chicken any day...
Blast... they really need to put times up on the webpage... doesn't start till 4pm... stupid add says 12-3
Yall should come join me for some 20$ crab legs ;-)

I'm gonna play by Vegas buffet rules... 4-5 plates, THEN desert ;-)
Stolen from my friend Lori Rist via Sarah Hruby's profile

Something ugly, lol

Yeah, I gave mine to a poor unfortunate soul who had never read them before.
Step ahead of you Katt...
I miss Taj daily :(
I hate you :(
Congrats
Have read it numerous times, sad, but amazing book.
Walking Dead is filmed here in Atlanta
Log, it's deff better than bad... it's good
hehe, I like that one, thank you AJ
Yeah, but you have it off. So it's not as bad.
sweet. shit man.
Glad you enjoying yourself up there.
It's a 4 day costume party... What's weird about that? :-D
You have no idea ;-)
It's perfect, best suited costume I saw all weekend.
He was SUUUPER smashed, and trying to be pick her up, as her boyfriend took the picture.
Yeah, I met Will Ferrel. Cool dude.
I love aperture... Edited, and posted all in minutes. :-D.
Confirmed it won't hit till wednesday. Fuck you Uncle Sam.
naturally it's gotta be anorexia
Again... you're just jealous ;-).
I will drink a bottle... But probably harder than wine.
Go you gonna have to get mine done at work :-/
Touche
Meh, still funny idea
That's a good question
GOGO drunken stumbles. Yes, they happen.... often :P
hrmmm.... sounds like you may be talking about me and that shithole I had :P
Dude... You BEST come see me in ATl this time.
Thank you Katt Winter for allowing me to pretend to be as cool as you by copying your post.
Yeah buddy. Gotta fill the hours I'm up cause if coffee... And counteract the effects...
I am ready for the con... but is the con ready for me?
Yea, well I don't work tomorrow. Less you count partying ;-).
HAHAHAHAHA Take a picture for me lmfao. You working tonight?
Woot woot.
I shall let her know.
Only if I can take that bike for a joy ride ;-). Miss my R6 :(
Me too. Care to roll down here and party hardy?
Rockin out at GSU, working full time at the Bux, living the dream.
I've been known to brush my teeth lay down in bed, and THEN decide that I wanted a smoke... hehe.
All good, has been a pretty easy couple of days, honestly... This is going to be a cake walk.
Was an easy day, considering... Only slightly grumpy... Could have been WAY worse.
That and all my classes are like a full mile apart from each other... I walked at least 5 miles, before noon, today. Then work till 10 :-/. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Aye, I thought we were going to end up following the yellow brick road for a bit Saida.
I hope you killed those biatches.
You just wish that a 4 day Halloween happened in Tucson. It's cool to be jealous, I understand.
Lol. I went cold turkey 3 weeks ago... Haven't had time to think about it, though.
Lucky you...
I think that C and D is the one you took.
now you got me wanting to cook some lasagna :P perhaps this weekend, after i get paid.
my pleasure :-D enjoy
;)

http://southernfood.about.com/od/chickenbreastrecipes/r/bl80517l.htm
or chicken parm
baked ziti is also super easy
Lasagna is pretty easy to do, and amazing to eat. You'll need ricotta, eggs, mozzerella and veggies/meat, plus the noodles. :-D
Hell's gate is an amazing spot. Super beautiful.
Hehe, I am honored.
Shit Matty, let's make a sound investment.
That Woodchuck wants to chuck more wood it seems.
Michael Fassbender hands down. James McAvoy seemed a bit too much like a chump.
Reposted from Heather Lynn Kinikin's page, thanks for sharing Heather. Enjoy sound investments today, and please... don't forget to share $1000 of beer is a LOT to drink yourself, I volunteer to help.
So sad that he was gone before I was able to see him live. RIP Jerry.
Yeah, I had plans to go hang out with friends from Yoghurtland after they closed up and while I I was waiting for them to finish this all went down. It sounded like it could have been a 9mm shot. But then again it could have easily been a car backfiring. Judging by the police response my initial assessment is probably the more accurate one, though. They showed up with 25+ cars, was amazing to see really. Made me feel pretty safe down there.
Get a black light out and scan the area, who knows what you might find :-P
Hehe yeah I'm frantically trying to come up with the ticket myself.
Aye, me too. He's a sneaky little bastard
No bueno
I miss my mountain. :(
Hope your trip to Indiana was a blast.
We'll Hotlanta will be glad to have you back. Starbucks has been empty without you hanging there all day :P.
Yes, and with collar.
I'm good, thanks. Time to be happy and move on with my life.
Dude that blows, you ok? btw how's your arm?
Nono, just me.
She decided to have the locks changed while I was staying at my parents, with all my gems and movies, tv, ps3, clothes, etc inside... When the maintanece men came to do the lock thing, cat musta gotten out. Least that's her story. End being he's gone.
Who knows... He's gone. Basically, she's assaulted me, leaving scars... Brandished scissors at me, last Saturday... and, in all probability, killed Little man. Worst breakup EVER, seriously...
Amazing
Awesome pic, sign me up.
I hurt myself today REAL bad.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA man i shoulda thought of that
Thanks. Cannot wait to start.
That looks like the beginning of a myceliul(sp) culture... I think it's pre-fruiting body, honestly.
Nah. Just didn't work yesterday.. Where are you tonight?
I am so bloody jealous.
That is freaking awesome.
A freaking blast gotta get the few pix I took up.
Lovely looking polyspores... look like Parchment variety to me.
where is that?
Freakin hilarious.
Learned from the best Leah
No zombie to come rapture them.
fucking HILARIOUS...
bald head and all.
I'm not going to do, what everyone thinks i'm gonna do and FREAK OUT MAN.... I just wanna know.... who's coming with me.
MMMM Jelly beans
Thank you Gma Nabhan for this link... Powerful stuff.
They are probably just extra bolts/screws cause lord knows they get lost easy.
Just moved and got one myself. It got a big huh with my first load of dishes.
330, and I got an errand to run for my broken kindle :-(. And stuff to get from parents house. No rest for the wicked.
Good luck, that place is freakin awesome. Is yours more home decorations, or do they have primarily food stuff?
By regular club, you mean regular in the sense that there were holes in the stalls in the bathroom, dontcha?
Mer, come visit. Right at Chastain Park. Bring the crazy pups down,
MMMM baby.... get in my belly
She was beat by this time, just ready to pass out.
This cat is giving Rhian the same look that Merrick gives a small animal before eating it.
gogo Wallaby, freaking cool animal.
she loved this swing.
Sure will.
He tried to push her around and tale the bike she was playing with. Did HE have another think coming.
Someone is a blizz fan ;-).
Children of the corn deserve a nice family to kill. Become a social worker, and give them a helping hand.
Thank you for posting for us Bryan.
Bryan, that is totally awesome.
I sat her down and asked her to sit there for a sec.
And only in the south will you find something that celebrates the anniversary of the civil war. Hell the rest of the country doesn't remember that it even happened.
that is kinda badass.
now she doesn't need to try to get daddy's glasses.
Ya know the cookie cakes??? One of our morning regulars works for them... We're "testing" a new one for them... Chocolate covered chocolate chip with icing stuffed between 2 cookies. And a box of M&m's. HELLLLLLLLLZ YEEEEAAAH!!!!'n
All is well, thx Judith. How was the Tucson gem show this year? Making tentative plans for next year.
That was the one I was linking, freaking hilarious.
Freaking hilarious.
Wooot woot, you's be famous now.
Have two options in the works, at the moment. We'll see which one pops off first. :-D.
;)
Sounds like some serious stuff... prolly makes the "truth" or "childrens" seems like cake.
There has actually been studies about something similar... They took a series of violent criminals and ran MRI's on them.... What they found was that these people had underdeveloped spots in their frontal lobe, if i remember correctly. They actually ARE missing a piece/pieces.
:-D
WTF is wrong with the world. Especially the damned attorney blaming the victim.
Japan has been brutalized.
I gotta say, he's got more ball than a gun toting hunter. At least he has to looks his victim in the eyes as he kills it.
bacon? bacon? baaaaaaacooooon.
what's the ##.
I love this pic.
HAHAHA that's hilarious.
He was the best x-man, yes. But from the movie, he had virtually NO role, one fight scene, and a pilot scene, nothing more really. He got shafted.
:P
In the trailer, the scene where they are on the motorcycle racing game... Owen Wilson and Jason Sudekis are looking right at me. Costuming had me in pretty much exactly what Owen was wearing, at one point, he leaned the bike over, and looked right at me, cocked his head, and raised an eyebrow. Was almost mirror image, belt and shoes only difference.
Coming out the 25th... Look for my ugly mug, spent 16 hours on set, SHOULD be in there.
Me 3. Cept for origins, they shafted Gambit.
hehehe. My back hurts from that chick beating my ass.
I have to pull all my stones outta storage, and set up for a business meeting this afternoon. Selling a bunch of moldavite, gonna see how much more I can sell to top that off. No rest for the wicked.
I feel like I got beat with a baseball bat this am. Had one chick take me out, 2-3 times. She was a bigger girl, and just plain bowled me over. All in all, it was a great time, but this am I am hurting, like mad. ankle is all messed up/sprained, back is toast. Just glad I do not work :-D.
Hahaha, Oh the good ole ale swillin hippie days.
Only would be happy with that, with a big mountain and a snowboard to ride it.
So glad that I do NOT live in Iowa, been tee shirt weather here, for a while.
you lucky S.O.B
I wanted it to look like a test run from the darkroom.
Tis a wonderful park right close to my house.
Credit goes to my beautiful other half... I just tinkered with the editing.
nah, just basic presets with aperture one of the black and white filters, blue perhaps?
This was the last night of our 29 again birthday trip. so taken the 13th of november.
I like how alot of it looks like it's been drawn with pen and ink.
Contrast of skin and the much darker background, not to mention some sun "glow"
Yeah, those bastards have no fear when it comes to protecting their young. And let me tell you from experience, as a kid, they can seriously mess you up.
Grayton Beach
Or learn good facebook fu and privitize your page really good like.
She's running off with Daddy's hat, durrrrrh. :-P
pretty sure I missed some from the desktop, too.
yeah, haven't done that part yet... just been organizing them a bit.
HOLY CRAP... I just reached the end of my facial recognition. WOOOOOOOT. Only 673 pictures of Rhian tagged, let alone everyone else.
better believe i'm jumping through the hoops like a trained circus animal. just tired of doing it.
or see my child.
haha, haven't even been able to start school, yet. and my folks are trying to make it really difficult to get everything to work to be there. let alone get out of the house.
so tired of having my life micro managed to the point where my say doesn't effin matter.
:(. i miss him so much. my brother from a diff mother.
Watch the movie the Miami Model. Or Battle in Seattle, prime examples of police brutality.
Texas cops are deff among those that will walk all over your rights to get to the "justice" they think is fair. Not a good place to be.
Aye, she's feeling MUCH better now.
To properly judge the level of geekiness... how much of that sequence was from memory?
woot pizza
Sado-masochism at it's best.
I'm missing it... Lived in a ski town for 3 years.
Chem.
SUPER LIKE.
Damn, when are yall going? gotta stop through Atl and meet the youngin :P.
WOOOT, go you.
Man I couldn't agree more. Women shouldn't be voting, it means they are no longer in the kitchen. BAD WOMAN, BACK TO THE KITCHEN.
can always pretend it's someone's b-day and get free cake.
You should shoot for 2 of em, take one for the team. Send one to me for giving you the idea.
Am sure Steve Jobs would hook you up with the 4k (bare) cpu if you did the RIGHT job for him.... would, also prolly help with your original problem.
I might add it's also a brand new one, from the Apple store.
$443.36 actually, but not far off, good guess.
I know, but I chose a new Macbook Pro over a fuckable flashlight. Cause what's not normal about having wild orgasms with your flashlight... Everyone does it.
Now off to play chase around the house with the baby and the dog.
< forgot how much fun playing on your threads are Kat.
shit, we can compliment till we're blue in the face, yall don't shut up enough to hear it.
just remember you gotta watch how much you talk in order to GET the dick.... 20 min too much of yapping, and we're bored to tears, then you get all emotional cause your hormones are nutty, and decide you don't wanna put out... then still out of dick.
WOOOOOOOOT good for you man.
Glad to say that work got closed, today. apparently the bux DOES close on occasion.
First off, it would appear that this snow IS closer to an Atlanta Apocalypse, we have 3-4" of snow, already. It's really coming down. Miss you too, Leah.
Ridding clothing of stains is still an ongoing process. they may just be done, we'll see.
She LOVES that pillow. Took a nap on it, this afternoon.
The funny thing is... He is trying to get a dog for his kids, now. What bs.
Aye sure is.
WOOOOT rock on man.
Not so fun in Atlanta where it turns to slush way fast.... TONS of fun when you have a couple feet of good snow, a big slope, and a board to strap on ure feet.
< sides with Matty and Kelsey... those deer hunters could accidentally hit either one of them. Or one of their horses.
TWICE...
aye.
Wait... You're playing again??? WTF man?
Where you working?? Da Starbucks??
:-D
Rock on.
Wahoo. Where are you in school dude?
Spring semester.
Thx.
Best of luck to you. Meeting the baby is an amazing experience.
Bet that's just how everyone that picks up their co-workers slack at the bux feels.
I agree... Eff the Bux... Can't wait to quit this damn job.
Oh, well shows what this tree huggin hippie knows about the military.
Happy b-day Snuffles. You're just a day ahead of my wife to be. Hope you have a great one.
The better to bite you with.
Tell the maintenance department you need your filter changed/possible duct cleaning.
You BEST still be heading my way the 19th, got most the weekend off.
Hey Mer, hope ure b-day was awesome. Sorry I'm late it sayin it, life is crazy these days. No time to come up for air it feels like.
I suppose yall didn't hear... SHE picked out her outfit ;-).
I always work nights. Stop by any time.
Holy shit thats amazing.
That's awesome, keep me posted.
Congratulations, how far along are you??
One's not lazy... Had knee surgery in the past 2 months, fresh outta the brace, but VERY restricted on what she can do. As for the other... Lazy doesn't even BEGIN to cover it. Worst part is she's the shift lead, and doesn't do a damned thing. Has literally been in the back, or on break for all but 30 min, MAYBE.
Will look way cooler on youtube with dude standing there, and then getting dropped. She's going for hits, not helpful.
dude that blows, sorry to hear it.
What the hell? that's rediculous. How's ure buddy?
what the heck happened?
I-loader is what the app is called, I believe. It effin rox.
freaking hilarious.
9.5 months.
Wait... Are you even in town??
I work at the one next to the OK Cafe.
@ Palmer the late wasn't mine, bur yes, I DID get to remake it.

@ Rachel apron caught the brunt of it... The burning sensation was no fun, though.
:-P yeah, tis an oldie, but goldie.
Bitchen man. It's about damned time.
Just checked, there's a more direct route than what we took, bout 12 hours long as you don't hit traffic.
It took us 13 hours to get to Indiana, and hour and a half from there to chi.. 16-18 hours, depending on stops, etc.
Yeah... She's truly an artist at the escape..
Aye, tis the dog too. the cat loves the dog.
Hehe. good times.
Yeah, she's good at that one, for sure.
Damn time flies.
No, it would seem ure not. How old are you, now?? 16? 17?
Where to??
Freaking hilarious.
Aww the munchkin's windsurfing :-P.
Power's back. Damnit.
Still no power... STIL not closed.
One hour without power... Can we close already please.
Over 30 min, still no power... MAY be an early night.
awesome ren fest.
On my camera.
You suck hiding on horde side. Come back to Nazgrel.
Agreed.
The zombie invasion is upon us... No other feasable explanation.
Even bible study groups come here, lol.
Slap a mofo.
you SHOULD be.
Not taking classes, have 5-6 schools within a 3 mile radius of my Starbucks store. Get an after school rush.
Awesome... Fever of 101.7.
Thanks Leah.
Aye.
I know people that have gotten them on a bicycle, so I would suppose yes. The mower thing isn't so uncommon in the dirty south, Stu.
Just wait man, more coming. Pulling stuff from the video camera, now. Getting everything all edited up, and posting. Tis a bit of a process.
Miss y'all too Leah. You should look into school in atl. Would love to have y'all close, specially since you'll have a little one not too far from Rhian's age.
And at least I work at a coffee shop... Gogo caffeine power.
Aye, true brew... Pretty sure her two from teeth coming in kept her up, orajell and tylonol saved the day.... Although she does NOT like the taste or orajell, lol.
They were pawing at each other, it was adorable... she'd swipe at him, he'd wave back down at here, neither making contact.
Totally not joking, this is exactly what I saw when I looked over... think we may be changing the height of the crib bed, tonight.
True brew... But would MUCH rather be home with my ladies.
Hrmmm that's a tough one... I'm gonna go with wet hot American summer.
Good for you man. Keep it up.
Jail?? what for??
Mostly good/crazy. Jugglying work, baby, etc not an easy task. Plus we are looking for a place to move to, although having a really hard time in the area we want.
I was reffering to Kim Jong-il. But I spose you DO count as a crazy midget communist, too. :P
I want to be in Vegas. Love going out to red rocks, 30 min outside the strip. Plus winning some $$ at craps is ALWAYS nice.
BLASPHEMY!!!! Dunkin Dougnuts blows the big one. Get ureself some REAL ice coffee.... go to Starbucks.
Aye, shall be a new stretch, pity yall aint here to join in the fun :-D.
Aye, tis why soccer seems to be a good match for the youngin.
Nah :P not yet. :(
Leah, you are MORE than welcome to come join us out here for some fishing. Take some time off, come cross the country, and enjoy the best the east has to offer.
Ure loss.
Rhian was LOVING the match, though, got all into it, kicking left and right, was super cute.
Hey, I'm watching a game at 230... Not my fault you work somewhere that plays sports early.
Yup, sure did. She's very proud of herself, though.
I-phone is freaking awesome man.
At least she didn't poo on my foot, or anything... ;-)
Add in the foul poo from this am and it's
Rhian: 900000000000000
Daddy zero

the nasty factor was off the charts. Daddy misses the days of her just eating mommies milk.
You too man.
Still can't stop watching it, huh?
Hellz yeah, you caught a fish, too. She'll be scrumptious, tomorrow ;-).
I would NEVER do such a thing :-p.
Dude, I spent 200+ hours building that damned thing, no way I was trashing it.
No pet store involved.... Spent the day at the pond, using the fly rod I built at NWA... Couldn't keep the fish off the hook... Gogo fish dinner.
Playing on her mat.
if it helps stop the oil leak, i MAY shave my head.
Lol. For an adopted person, who's never had anyone that looked like me, before, BIG TIME TRIP.
HAHAHA, just wait till you feed her, it's priceless.
Now I DEFF gotta give her a bath, and a 2nd change on the day. Mommy's turn to try spoon feeding, next ;-).
HAHAHA. Why am I not surprised to see a comment like that from you, Pammy. lol.
she wore WAY more than she ate :P.
where is this?
If you are planning on nursing, and haven't gotten one, already... Put a Boppy on your baby shower list, tis the best thing EVER. And a Bumpo chair is good, when ure little one starts holding it's head up. Rhian freaking loves those things.
Kick them in the nuts. And get your ticket flying into Atl for a day, or two :-P since you were sick as shit, when I was sitting at your house, with your parents, bastard.
Total light weight it appears.
that's funny.
WTF... how'd you get lucky enough to go to that beautiful place?
WTF... how'd you get lucky enough to go to that beautiful place?
I was going to tell you that Nazgrel says that WoW is good for fetal development, and that you needed to get back on.
I want it. I have cs4, currently, just don't have 200+ for the upgrade.
at least they got rid of the charge.
Wow, didn't even notice that the baby is standing up just leaning on me, no daddy hands.
lol.
I think this goes down in history as the oddest comment conversation in Facebook history.
Could always do the old burning bag of poo... Just make sure it's YOUR poo. Dog poo is overrated.
Have fun.
bastard
:-D we did.... was a wonderful way to wrap up a long road trip.
Love it, very beautiful.
Glad to hear you feeling better, my friend. Best come to ATL when you get to the states, again.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEWgs6YQR9A
Roflmao
She's been a touch fussy, for the past hour, but slept the other part. In Nashville, stopped for the night.
Just hit Tennesee, actually.
Best come to ATL jewbag.
That means your punks ass best come to Atl.
Balls... I leave the 9th
Lauren, I cannot believe that the KY above didn't give it away.
To visit rachel's fam.
Dude, you BETTER be here before next Friday, going out with her sis Friday.
Of course YOU would know, Dawn.
Woot, we're leaving, today, to head up to Valpo, IN. lemmie know when you hit town.
Dude, you BETTER be in Chicago, to see me.
:-P just gotta remember to drink H2O after you are done getting drunk :-P
Couldn't get my damned work shift covered, not going to make today's shoot, total drag.
Next year some time.
gonna be a "golfer" for this one :P
Hallpass, again.
Yeah, was only there for like 50 min, wasn't too bad. Arizona was a 20 minute venture, however, so it FELT like an eternity.
Shoulda brought my damned book.
Tis freaking crazy here, aint it?
That's what you gotta do... If the driver was insured they are liable. They just count on people not payng the 400+ per hour, for a lawyer
Especially State Farm.
Did you get hit?? Btw most insurance companies just want to KEEP the $$. Filing a class action lawsuit is the only way, most of the time.
I sure do, It was greatly appreciative.
Jamaca??????
Aye, was only a bit late cause of it.
Van was already on the way.
Probably.
you bastard
I swear these Christians are fucking CRAZY, dumber and dumber as life goes on.
PS Rachel says she's gonna build a time machine, jump you for that shirt and deliver it to herself while her eggo was preggo.
So, my baby started to fuss at me, the other day, so I put on the warcrack and sat her in my lap... Within seconds, she forgot that she was upset. Her eyes got all big, her mouth slowly dropped open, it was priceless. I gots a geek outside. BTW, love that freaking shirt.
Lol, those babies, always trying to eat SOMETHING crazy.
IDK man, she's REALLY good about diaper changes... She lifts her legs/butt for me, and smiles the entire time. All in all, she LOVES the diaper change thing.
Y'all played dress up, today, I spose.
That IS adorable, how did I miss that?
Lol, the paparazzi starting mighty young.
How far along are you, my dear?
Not like we didn't all know, already.
I just made the noodles by eye, and cut veggies by the tons. Had just enough for 3 lasaganas, hense the 3. They all relatively the same, although one has different sauce than the others. All amazing, though :-P.
Yeah. Sounds fun to me... Well, prolly not.
Tis a blast. Apparently I'm looking good, today, been VERY close to the camera in two of the takes. Met Cameron Diaz's x-bf from What Happens in Vegas, the one that got the nutshot, in the credits. Seems like a decent dude.
Woooot
but trees NEED urine to survive, little known fact.
It was damned close to the sack, man, no lie. Got the jewels and my leg outta the way, at the sacrifice of my arm.
Yeah, no kidding.
lol, I bark in public all the time. Typically at random strangers.
Yeah, not sure why it's taking so long.
LOTS of rum.
Just tell them that the best way to get rid of a hang over is to "have a little hair off the dog that bit ya..." in layman's terms, have another shot.
Byob, not enough funds to get EVERYONE drunk. Although we could pitch in and get a pony keg, perhaps.
Right back atcha, my dear. You and Foose need to take a trip this way, meet the family, have some fun, go fishing, or something.
Go to Starbucks and get a triple grande 5 pump dark cherry white mocha. It will rock your world.
As we are not married, MOMMY earned the tax credit, as she makes a LOT more. Got last year, too, since she came before the year was up ;-).
Master of the Dojo drops the onyx, as I remember.
Grats. Working on getting some mats for my rumble to get onyx. Tis what I get for not hunting master of dojo fiercly, when I was there. Wanted out asap.
I bet they are. Especially Omar.
lucky you
who want's to drink WITH me????
not one :(
damn, that's fucked up/
Riding a horse or something??
Dammit... That is EXACTLY what I used for day 1 of my hunt. Day two started in on Brie and white cheddar.
What setup and cheese were you using?? Currently nanny/magma and Brie or sb+... Tried white cheddar to no avail. Been in the meadow for 2 days attempting, no luck thusfar.
Robert grew up.
DAMN...
I needed one last night, myself.
But of course, she's been getting the smootchy smootchy a lot of the morning.
:P
Me? GOOFING OFF??? Why I never...
Yay, Mommy kisses.
Daddy must be doing something stupid off camera.... As per usual.
Yo Adrian! It's me, Rocky.
Yeah, I'm a big girl, even got my own chair.... What the hell is daddy doing?????
That sounds like warcrack speak to me.
Glad I can help.
Sorry to hear that. hope it all gets better for you.
Sorry to hear that AJ. Hope you find some one without a cat. Little man is actually getting over his Riot trauma, nowish.
Lol, no kidding.
Woot, my better half was due on my dad's b-day, but our beautiful girl came for new years. Best b-day EVER, always a HUGE party for her.
No kidding, Paige. Shall be freaking awesome.
The one in the red case. It is awesome, just like the first one. Bunch of new powers too. Get it, it's amazing.
Alex, wasn't that new years?
Yeah, I know, yall hate me, now :-P. Be jealous, it's cool.
Indonesia
Right on glad it made it there.
Woooooot!!!!!!!!!!
All is well with my little family. Rhian is growing incredibly fast, Rachel is happy to have her body back, and everyone is happy to see the munchkin. She is the easiest baby ever. Rarely screams, and when she DOES it can usually be solved, temporarly, by picking her up.
Still rolling a bit, wine is my sleep aide tonight, wooooot.
I totally DID mention something about the smudge on someones head. Dude tried to "save" me, lol. Told him my soul belonged to bealzebub, and thanked him for his concern for my well being. He looked scared of me, lol.
yeah, look how pathetic OURS was, though, lol. This was taken at like 940 am.
Cause 2" isn't enough snow for much... And Atlanta has a lack of mountains for skiing. Tis a shame, my snowboard is begging to get wet
That's what the weather people are calling it.
Thanks. She's been a blast. Super sweet.
Thankies.
2010, tis the year of sin :-D.
Damn, that was like SOOOOO yesterday. You need to catch up with the times Katt.
You wear happiness well.
That's awesome.
what effect did you lay over it?
Dude, that rocks.
Why for my dear?
Right on, tell him I say hello. Hope he's doin well.
Big time. Was a good one, though.
Really? Daddio back in az huh?
Thank you, my dear. All you McChesney types are welcome to come by and meet the baby, any time.
Thank you my dear.
Aren't we? Gotta love this easy baby.
yeah, it sure took a LONG ass time to get in and hired, etc.
W paces ferry right at the ok cafe
thank you my dear :-D. you will have to come by and meet her, Austin too, for that matter.
Aye that it has.
Hopefully I will be finding out, tomorrow, how cool it REALLY is.
Funny, my missing cat was named Jerry. Although he would clean his OWN puke most of the time. If he didn't do it, my dog sure did. Then again, I usually encouraged that. Lucky her, that I have NEVER gotten upset with her over eating puke.
We are still at the hospital, just trying to get through this shit, and get a little rest. In the past 48 hours, I have gotten MAYBE 6 hours of sleep, no joke. I bloody HATE hospitals, ALWAYS someone that wants to walk in and take vitals, or something.
best b-day we could give her... not to mention the year of tax break.
Well, looks like you beat me to getting it up online :-P
hell, yall are going to be fairly close to my neck of the woods. You should stop by.
Was a little disconcerting to try to lift it to brush the sleep outta my eye, and have it flop uselessly. It was totally dead asleep.
< cooking chili
sounds nice :-P
I think those strange glyphs that you deciphered is called writing :-P.
HOLY SHIT, SHE'S DRINKING NOW???
hahaha, they are baked, me thinks.
The scene I am in is kinda a cut scene from "reality." Basically it's about an actor that's down on his luck, and moves in with his sister's friend.... He is telling them about a show he's sposed to do. That's where I come in.
No shit, yeah, like 2 years to get divorced. Longer than I was actually married for, haha.
Yeah, was a good time :-P. Will put some pictures up shortly. Cooking now, then photos.
Neh, have done acting before, easy money, very little work. As I need $$ for a baby, figured i'd put myself out and see what happens.
Dirty Rat Bastards.
Yeah, they fucked me, too. Sent my money to SPAIN. Then, when I called fruad, refuned my 1500+ only to pull it back out, deciding that there was no fruad. Now they want me to pay THEM 2k to cover the ammount pulled, PLUS overdraft fees, for an account THEY over drafted. FUCK B of A.
My kind of pineapples??
Ok, looks like it will be easier to search the registry out using Rachel's name, as they put her in as the main.
Yeah, that's the one. Lol.
Looks like you may have to search my name, or Rachel's to pull it up :-/
I tried, just couldn't get a good one.
HAHAHA, she looks like Tommy Chong, here.
Spankies.
just got it, the other day.
Ummm, to use it in a legal battle, no, it is not. Other than that, I think you are fine. OH, or brodcasting for profit, possibly youtube, not sure.
:P
Holcome Bridge Road.
prolly, although tis at the holcome bride store, not the one where we at.
HAHAHAHA. I didn't see this shiz yet. Flippin awesome
LMFAO... Yeah, you got me, Dawn.
although I REALLY suck at that.
Me, too, but either way, twas fun to play with it, till i got it, right. can add makeup, too ;-).
hehe, yeah, just learned that trick with photoshop. fun, aint it :-P
:-P Just some boredom. My mom gave her the outfit for "Sunday in the Park" and we decided to take a few pics. Can you spot what's odd about the shot, though?
Georgia state University.
hehe
lmfao, that's priceless
aye, that she is :-P
:-P yummmy eyeball, my favorite flavor.
Ahhh, California. You ever make it out anywhere in AZ?
Beautiful line, where's it at? AZ?
YES IT WILL.
Priceless
REALLY??? You had a Mohawk? How long did THAT last??
:-P Great minds think alike.
Dance around a campfire naked??
Aye, and I was touched by the noodley appendage. I have been enlightened.
I am so very jealous. I have yet to be able to make it to the burn.
lmfao
what is?? life?
good for you :-D
hehe.
I got mine out almost 2 months ago, now. I had a terrible experience, due to my bottom two being REALLY hard to get to. I still have one of the holes, that hasn't closed. 2 weeks of excruciating pain and LOTS of perccocet and I felt ok, hope you have a btter experience
Point, very well taken
Hehe, was too much fun. Of course, with this costume, came the responsibility of acting like a total jackass.
aye
starfox meets jedi
Lol, the superman dyed lips, how cute :-P.
lol, yeah it was SUPER nice.
Although we went from on bathroom to the next buildings bathroom, all day.
no kidding, tons of them.
So do many of them. They make $$ by taking the $$ and trying to refuse to honor their payouts.
similar getup, same eye thing, in purple will link the pic to ure email in a sec.
Damned south sucks to live in, currently.
damn, didn't even see him, while I was there, bummer.
It was flippin CRAZY on Friday. 4 hours of hot, wild nerd determination. Sat and Sun were a breeze.
I have one of her in a diff costume, NOT in the line. lol.
my shots of the jellyies didn't turn out NEARLY this good. What is your secret?
I gots me TONS of pictures when we went, V-day. Got the King Tut and aquarium passes in a combined deal.
Well, my girl would have had something to say about me slappin the tall chicks arse. She hit mine with the crop, actually. lol.
stupid flash didn't go as good as i would have liked.
gotta love the cheetah girls coming down, lol. see next few shots for them attacking a Ron Jeremy look alike.
The aquarium is amazing, aint it?
and why not??
I DID chase people around with the ray gun, I might add. Good times. If anyone has a picture of my crazy arse, please send it over.
6'1" barefoot, in 3" heels, complete with riding crop, and the desire to use it. Yes, I had to sacrifice a slap on the arse, for rights to take photos of her. Fair trade, I suppose.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxIAg-lMd-U

Touche
huh
It usually does.
She did, I had a conflicting appointment. Daddy just gets pics, this round. Was just the "proof of pregnancy" thing, and the Christian group that put it on, also, did free ultrasounds. They weren't trained past the first trimester, so still a 50/50 guess as to the sex ;-).

Agreed, although it WAS quite the candid shot, snuck up on her with the camera :-P
possible, but the pictures were really hard to figure out, and the lady that took them wasn't trained past the first trimester.
thanks man :-D
thanks man :-D
they bomb, that's for sure, great breakfast.
thanks :-D.
thanks:-D.
WHY??????
19 weeks 2 days
Aye, that I am.
That's right, I'm the special kinda guy that can GET preggo.
That's right, I'm the special kinda guy that can GET preggo.
Yeah, yummy. good thing he was scared shitLESS, coulda been nasty.
lmfao that's awesome.
Let me reiterate my loathing of you, right here. YOU BASTARD. I FIT IN A DAMNED SUITCASE.
Let me reiterate my loathing of you, right here. YOU BASTARD. I FIT IN A DAMNED SUITCASE.
That's a happy puppy face.
shit, I wanna live HERE.
I correct that, I don't think he's been seen since Wed, last week, he's been gone 7 days :-/
You damned straight I am! Best respect.
wisdom teeth removed, this morning.
agreed with bridgette, fuck the redsocks.
glad to hear it:-D.
HOLY HELL that's hilarious.
in addendum, it would appear that she is TERRIFIED of fireworks
aye, strange that it has only occured on the 4th. EVER.
Grats, happy for you.
Hehe, I'm like an onion in that regard.
Frankly, I have no respect for one of his like, but will stop, since others seem more squeamish, won't post any more.
that van IS cool as shit.
:-D ding dong the freak is dead.
Where every child molester SHOULD be, six feet under.
I wonder what happened to him to warrant that? You never really know, and the media sure as shit isn't going to tell us.
Aye, that would be the one. Howdy Erica.
Hehe, sure was.
Angie you may enjoy checking this out, tis a movement that is trying to change everything.
http://www.thevenusproject.com/index.php
The FTAA, ie the idea that coorperations can send their labor to other countries, pay them 6$ a day, and take jobs from our citizens.
when you get home, you shall see the OTHER link, which is WAY worse. Unarmed protesters shot with rubber bullets, expressing their right to free assembly. Crowds that are dispersing due to threat of violence, then assaulted by the police, even though they are doing what they are asked. Pepper spray, placed upon foreheads, and then emptied, directly into the eyes of the protesters. I was planning on attending that protest, with friends, but our ride fell through. My hat is off to the brave individuals that tried to take to the streets, and protect everyone else, in the face of such brutality.
Again, not for the feint of heart, VERY brutal film. Also 90+min long. Watch only if/when you have time.
Damn, you look WAY different, with that short hair.
cool shiz.
cool shiz.
aye, me too.
that's fine, I haven't been on nazgrell, in a while, really, haven't played in a while, taking a break like thing.
like mother, like daughter ;-)
Hommie, that's no bueno, go back home, even I had to :(
yeah, you are just jealous of my powers of deductive reasoning ;-).
Well, I would say that the bag of Wheat thins, at your feet, would be the most likely culprit.
the important thing is, was it a lady, at the bar, or a guy? Cause the lady doesn't sound bad, by comparison.
Yeah, scary shit, huh?
looks like something you would xpect to see worn by a viking, lol.
There are 4 in that tank, currently ;-).
Perhaps that's because you are an elf??
Actually, their tank is large enough to have 6 full grown ones, there. They have plans to breed them.
hehe.
i can only imagine what would have happened with your pirate brigade+fire. "oh shit put me out"
(dumps rum) "damnit, now the rum's gone AND the fire's outta control, my bad"
and that you should, had the ENTIRE audience on the edge of their seats, wondering if you were going to go up in a blaze of fire. We were ALL very concerned.
Either way, she would have wanted to go to the car, and change out of the burnt skirt. Also think that there were quite a few people ready to jump up, and assist with putting out the fire, lol.
HAHAHA, yeah, there was sure a close call, there. Glad I didn't have to walk her to the car, with a burnt off skirt, amongst all the drunk, dirty old men.
Rachel, looking a lot like Big foot, a bit blurry.
yeah, we are both reiki healers.
Don't member, but "it was pretty funny"
stupid fucking killer bees
Bitchin:-p
You know I will. I'm still pissed that I couldn't make it there, before I left. Hopefully I'll be around for the gem show, next year.
how ya been, ms maggie, been ages.
Life is going quite well. Got n amazing girlfriend, quit smoking cigarettes, getting shit back together, and, hopefully, into a few classes, soon. good times, all around.
Aye, that it is, NOT EASY.
no deaths... yet.
i was next ;-)
Heather, my x that visited, from Boston.
HAHA, blast from the past.
you're looking a lot healthier than the last time I saw you.
Boulder Creek, in Boulder, CO
HAHAHA that is perty funny, for sure
massage therapy, huh, right on. Was trying to get into classes, myself, but didn't work out, as planned:-(.
that mean you coming back to ATL?
now THAT'S right up ure alley, cool shiz, am jealous.
so, guess what... i'm going in on the test server, going to hit the newest raid, that hasn't been released, yet;-)
WAHOOOOOO better come visit me, on nazgrel, damnit
tisk tisk
Beatles.
Aye, he was fucking amazing. Really well done movie.
you lucky bastard
I'm jealous as hell, too, damn you are lucky.
In Atlanta, now.
damnit, i'm jealous, wanted to hit Red Rocks, and Vegas, before I moved back east, but didn't have the time, NOR the funds.
haha, nice. He's probably just wanting to keep in touch with his baby girl. Tis how it goes.
lol, apparently not down with the golden shower, huh:-P
yup yup, specially when you broke, like a joke.
yeah, it IS a lot to consider, and no, this one is a good bit beyond ranting.
because I talked to my parents and they are being straight DOUCHE BAGS, about my coming back. It would seem that I will have to sell my soul to go back there. Is it worth it?
may have just changed my mind on that one, parents are being douche bags.
yeah, was a strange situation, honestly. Fuckers were there in like 5 min, or less. honestly, will prolly get dismissed, so not TOO much to worry about.
as i remember it was fucking COLD as SHIT, and super windy, lol
i sure as fuck did, lol, but FUCK EM. and YES i was in LOTS of trouble for that, but that was just the beginning of it, all. Got worse AFTER that, hehe.
Yar matey, that's a sexy pirate if I ever saw one. you look absolutely gorgeous.
